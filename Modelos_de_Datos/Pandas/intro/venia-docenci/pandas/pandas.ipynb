    "\n",
    "`conda install pandas`\n",
    "\n",
    "pandas is a Python package providing fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with “relational” or “labeled” data both easy and intuitive. It aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for doing practical, real world data analysis in Python. Additionally, it has the broader goal of becoming the most powerful and flexible open source data analysis / manipulation tool available in any language. It is already well on its way toward this goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "pandas is well suited for many different kinds of data:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Tabular data with heterogeneously-typed columns, as in an SQL table or Excel spreadsheet\n",
    "- Ordered and unordered (not necessarily fixed-frequency) time series data.\n",
    "- Arbitrary matrix data (homogeneously typed or heterogeneous) with row and column labels\n",
    "- Any other form of observational / statistical data sets. The data actually need not be labeled at all to be placed into a pandas data structure\n",
    "\n",
    "The two primary data structures of pandas, Series (1-dimensional) and DataFrame (2-dimensional), handle the vast majority of typical use cases in finance, statistics, social science, and many areas of engineering. For R users, DataFrame provides everything that R’s data.frame provides and much more. pandas is built on top of NumPy and is intended to integrate well within a scientific computing environment with many other 3rd party libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are just a few of the things that pandas does well:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Easy handling of missing data (represented as NaN) in floating point as well as non-floating point data\n",
    "- Size mutability: columns can be inserted and deleted from DataFrame and higher dimensional objects\n",
    "- Automatic and explicit data alignment: objects can be explicitly aligned to a set of labels, or the user can simply ignore the labels and let Series, DataFrame, etc. automatically align the data for you in computations\n",
    "- Powerful, flexible group by functionality to perform split-apply-combine operations on data sets, for both aggregating and transforming data\n",
    "- Make it easy to convert ragged, differently-indexed data in other Python and NumPy data structures into DataFrame objects\n",
    "- Intelligent label-based slicing, fancy indexing, and subsetting of large data sets\n",
    "- Intuitive merging and joining data sets\n",
    "- Flexible reshaping and pivoting of data sets\n",
    "- Hierarchical labeling of axes (possible to have multiple labels per tick)\n",
    "- Robust IO tools for loading data from flat files (CSV and delimited), Excel files, databases, and saving / loading data from the ultrafast HDF5 format\n",
    "- Time series-specific functionality: date range generation and frequency conversion, moving window statistics, moving window linear regressions, date shifting and lagging, etc."

    "## Series and Dataframes\n",
    "\n",
    "The best way to think about the pandas data structures is as flexible containers for lower dimensional data. For example, DataFrame is a container for Series, and Series is a container for scalars. We would like to be able to insert and remove objects from these containers in a dictionary-like fashion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, we would like sensible default behaviors for the common API functions which take into account the typical orientation of time series and cross-sectional data sets. When using ndarrays to store 2- and 3-dimensional data, a burden is placed on the user to consider the orientation of the data set when writing functions; axes are considered more or less equivalent (except when C- or Fortran-contiguousness matters for performance). In pandas, the axes are intended to lend more semantic meaning to the data; i.e., for a particular data set there is likely to be a “right” way to orient the data. The goal, then, is to reduce the amount of mental effort required to code up data transformations in downstream functions."
