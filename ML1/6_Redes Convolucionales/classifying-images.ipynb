    "You may have heard many times that Deep Learning only works when you have large amounts of data. This is partly true: one of the characteristics of Deep learning is that you can find interesting features from the training dataset itself, and this a priori is easier when you have many examples available, especially in the case of having input datasets with a high dimensionality, such as images.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, what constitutes a \"large\" dataset is relative. Specifically relative to the size and depth of the network we are trying to train. It is not possible to sand a convnet so that it becomes a complete problem with only a few dozen examples, but a few hundred can be enough if the model is well assembled (we will understand what \"well assembled\" means throughout the Deep Learning course).\n",
    "\n",
    "Since convnets learn local characteristics, invariant under translations, they are very efficient in terms of the number of images needed to carry out perceptual problems. So training a convnet from 0 with a not very large dataset can still lead to reasonable results as we will see here.\n",
    "\n",
    "But there is more: Deep Learning models are highly \"recyclable\". One can, for example, take an image classification problem and a trained speech-to-text converter on a very big dataset and then reuse it for solving a completely different problem only by adding some small modifications. More specifically, in the case of Computer Vision, many pre-trained models (usually trained on the ImageNet dataset) are made public so that one can download them and use them to create powerful Computer Vision models with very little data.\n",

We start using 150x150 input images (an arbitrary choice), and end up with feature maps that are 7x7 in size before the flattening layer.\n",

Keras has a module with tools for image processing, which can be found in `keras.preprocessing.image`. In particular, it contains the class `ImageDataGenerator` that allows us to automatically convert images we have on the hard disk into pre-processed tensors. This is exactly what we'll be using next. To do this we can use the flow_from_directory to take the images directly from the folders that we previously generated. We give it as input the folders where the training (or validation) images are, the size of the images (target_size), the size of the batch we're going to use (we're going to start with 20) and as there are only two categories, we tell it that we're going to use binary_crossentropy (class_mode).
