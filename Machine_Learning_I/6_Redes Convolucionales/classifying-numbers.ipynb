    "Let's create a first basic convnet. It's a stack of 'Conv2D' and 'MaxPooling2D' layers. \n",
    "The important thing to note is that a convnet takes as input tensors of size `(image_height, image_width, image_channels)`. \n",
    "To do this we must first find out the size of the images in our dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "The network must have the following layers:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A convolutional layer (Conv2D) with 32 3x3 filters and relu activation. In this first layer you must indicate the size of the input (input_shape).\n",
    "- A second layer of Max Pooling (MaxPooling2D) of 2x2\n",
    "- A third convolutional layer with 64 3x3 filters and light activation\n",
    "- A fourth layer of 2x2 Max Pooling (MaxPooling2D)\n",
    "- A fifth convolutional layer of 64 3x3 filters and light activation\n",

    "\n",
    "The next step would be to give our last tensor (of dimensions (3, 3, 64)) as input to a densely connected network. These classifiers process vectors, which are 1D, while our output is a 3D tensor. So first we will have to flatten our 3D output and convert it to 1D and then add a few dense layers:\n",
