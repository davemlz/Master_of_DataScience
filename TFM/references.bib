abstract = {Following extreme flooding in eastern Australia in 2011, the Australian Government established a programme to improve access to flood information across Australia. As part of this, a project was undertaken to map the extent of surface water across Australia using the multi-decadal archive of Landsat satellite imagery. A water detection algorithm was used based on a decision tree classifier, and a comparison methodology using a logistic regression. This approach provided an understanding of the confidence in the water observations. The results were used to map the presence of surface water across the entire continent from every observation of 27 years of satellite imagery. The Water Observation from Space (WOfS) product provides insight into the behaviour of surface water across Australia through time, demonstrating where water is persistent, such as in reservoirs, and where it is ephemeral, such as on floodplains during a flood. In addition the WOfS product is useful for studies of wetland extent, aquatic species behaviour, hydrological models, land surface process modelling and groundwater recharge. This paper describes the WOfS methodology and shows how similar time-series analyses of nationally significant environmental variables might be conducted at the continental scale.},

abstract = {The study deals with the first comprehensive spatial distribution and area estimate of seagrass patches of India with a standardized methodology. Seagrass patches are mainly located in Palk Bay – Gulf of Mannar (Tamil Nadu), Gulf of Kachchh (Gujarat), Chilika Lake (Odisha) and Islands of Andaman {\&} Nicobar and Lakshadweep. Medium resolution satellite images of Landsat 8 OLI were subjected to radiometric, atmospheric and water column correction prior to digital classification and contextual editing. Total estimated seagrass area amounts to 516.59 km2 of which Palk Bay and Gulf of Mannar of Tamil Nadu together contribute to 398.81 km2. Overall classification accuracy for the six sites studied, ranged between 64{\%} (Lakshadweep Islands) and 83.5{\%} (Palk Bay). This suggests that for surveillance studies of homogeneous seagrass meadows with low interspersion of other benthic units such as corals, seaweeds etc., digital mapping using medium resolution data sets with mandatory attenuation correction procedures is suitable. The results of this study and the related area statistics were accepted as a baseline at national level for the delineation of Ecologically Sensitive Areas (ESA) and in the formulation of its conservation strategies. For a cursory appraisal of the status of major seagrass regions, a matrix representation of its locational occurrence and habitat characteristics is provided.},

abstract = {Late-winter lake ice regimes are controlled by water depth relative to maximum ice thickness (MIT). When MIT exceeds maximum water depth, lakes freeze to the bottom with bedfast ice (BI) and when MIT is less than maximum water depth lakes have floating ice (FI). Both airborne radar and space-borne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery (Ku-, X-, C-, and L-band) have been used previously to determine whether lakes have a BI or FI regime in a given year, across a number of years, or across large regions. In this study, we use a combination of ERS-1/2, RADARSAT-2, Envisat, and Sentinel-1 SAR imagery for seven lake-rich regions in Arctic Alaska to analyze lake ice regime extents and dynamics over a 25-year period (1992–2016). Our interactive threshold classification method determines a unique statistic-based intensity threshold for each SAR scene, allowing for the comparison of classification results from C-band SAR data acquired with different polarizations and incidence angles. Additionally, our novel method accommodates declining signal strength in aging extended-mission satellite SAR instruments. Comparison of SAR ice regime classifications with extensive field measurements from six years yielded a 93{\%} accuracy. Significant declines in BI regimes were only observed in the Fish Creek area with 3{\%} of lakes exhibiting transitional ice regimes—lakes that switch from BI to FI during this 25-year period. This analysis suggests that the potential conversion from BI to FI regimes is primarily a function of lake depth distributions in addition to regional differences in climate variability. Remote sensing of lake ice regimes with C-band SAR is a useful tool to monitor the associated thermal impacts on permafrost, since lake ice regimes can be used as a proxy for of sub-lake permafrost thaw, considered by the Global Climate Observing System as an Essential Climate Variable (ECV). Continued winter warming and variable snow conditions in the Arctic are expected and our long-term analysis provides a valuable baseline for predicting where potential future lake ice regimes shifts will be most pronounced.},

abstract = {Freshwater resources are among the most basic requirements of human society. Nonetheless, global information about the space-time variations of the area of freshwater bodies, and the water stored in them, is surprisingly limited. We introduce a new approach that uses MODIS multispectral data to map the global areal extent and temporal variations of known reservoirs at 500 m spatial resolution at nominal eight-day intervals from 2000 to 2015. We evaluate the performance of the approach on 94 reservoirs by comparing the variations in surface area extents with satellite radar altimetry measurements. Furthermore, we present detailed case studies for five reservoirs on four continents to demonstrate the impact of different challenges on the performance of the approach. For three of these case studies, we also evaluate surface area estimates using Landsat-based surface extent reference maps. Altimetry based height measurements for the 94 reservoirs show higher correlation with surface area computed using our approach, compared to surface area computed using previous approaches. One of the main reasons for these improvements is a novel post-processing technique that makes use of imperfect labels produced by supervised classification approaches on multiple dates to estimate the elevation structure of locations and uses it to enhance the quality and completeness of imperfect labels. However, effective estimation of this elevation structure requires that the water body shows sufficient area variations. Hence, the post-processing approach will not be effective for water bodies that are mostly unchanged or are too small to have sufficient variation. The approach is still challenged in regions with frequent cloud cover, snow and ice coverage, or complicated geometries that will require remote sensing data at finer spatial resolution. The surface area estimates we describe here are publically available.},

abstract = {Normally, to detect surface water changes, water features are extracted individually using multi-temporal satellite data, and then analyzed and compared to detect their changes. This study introduced a new approach for surface water change detection, which is based on integration of pixel level image fusion and image classification techniques. The proposed approach has the advantages of producing a pansharpened multispectral image, simultaneously highlighting the changed areas, as well as providing a high accuracy result. In doing so, various fusion techniques including Modified IHS, High Pass Filter, Gram Schmidt, and Wavelet-PC were investigated to merge the multi-temporal Landsat ETM+ 2000 and TM 2010 images to highlight the changes. The suitability of the resulting fused images for change detection was evaluated using edge detection, visual interpretation, and quantitative analysis methods. Subsequently, artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), and maximum likelihood (ML) classification techniques were applied to extract and map the highlighted changes. Furthermore, the applicability of the proposed approach for surface water change detection was evaluated in comparison with some common change detection methods including image differencing, principal components analysis, and post classification comparison. The results indicate that Lake Urmia lost about one third of its surface area in the period 2000-2010. The results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, especially Gram Schmidt-ANN and Gram Schmidt-SVM for surface water change detection.},

The model of assigning the ecological status was implemented in GIS for the northern part of Poland and classifies lake quality for several classes according to classification of WFD using two basic assumptions. The first is that there exists a combination of OLI bands (OLI2/OLI4 was used) which correlates well with the trophic state of the lakes; the second assumption is that the reference trophic state depends on the mean depth of the lake. The model uses a lake geodatabase which contains lakes outlines, raster masks of lakes and attribute information about their mean depth. There is no need to provide any field data when using this tool, as calibration of the model is done using subsets of lakes which were classified using legally defined methods. The tool allows fast classification of 2800 lakes from the area of interest. The results show good agreement between satellite and expert based methods.},

abstract = {The Uvs Lake Basin in western Mongolia is a natural world heritage site and is known for its diversity in landscape and wildlife. Recently, investigative research has shown that the protected pristine ecotone is suffering land degradation due to global warming. In order to obtain evidence of the changes over a long-term time scale, serial multi-temporal Landsat images obtained between 1995 and 2015 were used to classify land cover and land cover changes over the Basin ecoregion using a machine learning classification technique, support vector machine. Results showed that the forest land area in 1995 was 1888.48 km 2 which was equivalent to 7.48{\%} of the total area of the study site. The forest area showed considerable decrease by 301.36 km 2 during the first decade (1995–2004) and 155.81 km 2 during second decade (2004–2015). A total of 457.17 km 2 or 24.21{\%} of the forest land has been developed, most being changed into grassland. The major driver of such changes was illegal logging, forest fire, and pest damage. However grassland was changed primarily into bare land during the two decades. The area of glacier was decreased and primarily changed into water body. In contrast, the area of sand in the Basin ecoregion increased dramatically from 65.20 km 2 in 1995 to 318.33 km 2 in 2015 the increase being mostly from the transition of bare land. In summary, the drivers of the significant decrease of greenness coverage and increase of sand/bare land areas were the interaction of complicated disturbances in both anthropogenic and natural factors, in which logging, grazing, wind erosion, and global warming were the key causes.},

abstract = {Knowledge of the composition and areal distribution of aquatic vegetation types, as well as their seasonal and interannual variations, is crucial for managing and maintaining the balance of lake ecosystems. In this study, a series of remotely sensed images with a resolution of 30 m (HJ-CCD and Landsat TM) were collected and used to map the distribution of aquatic vegetation types in Taihu Lake, China. Seasonal and interannual dynamics of aquatic vegetation types were explored and analyzed. The distribution areas of Type I (emergent, floating-leaved and floating vegetation) and Type II (submerged vegetation) were used to model their growing season phenology by double logistic functions. The resulting double logistic models showed, the area of Type I reached its peak in mid-August, and the maximum area for Type II occurred in mid-September. From 1984 to 2013, Type I area increased continuously from 59.75 km{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} to 148.00 km{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} (R{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} = 0.84), whereas the area covered by Type II first increased and then decreased, with a trend conforming to a significant quadratic curve (R{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} = 0.83). The eutrophication and stable state of Taihu Lake was assessed using a simple indicator which was expressed as a ratio of Type II area to Type I area. The results showed that the eutrophication in the lake might have been increasing in the area studied since 2000. Additionally, the results showed that air temperature had likely a direct effect on the growth of Type I (R{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} = 0.66) and a significant, but delayed, effect on the growth of Type II.},

abstract = {Macrophytes are important components of freshwater ecosystems, playing a relevant role in carbon and nutrient cycles. Notwithstanding their widespread diffusion in temperate to subtropical shallow lakes, little effort has been performed so far in extensively mapping macrophyte communities at regional to continental scale. A rule-based classification scheme was implemented for mapping four macrophyte community types (helophyte, emergent rhizophyte, floating, and submerged-floating association). Input features were selected among multi-spectral reflectance and multi-temporal vegetation indices, based on Landsat data acquired over four test sites: Lake Taihu (China), Kis-Balaton wetland (Hungary), Lake Trasimeno and Mantua Lakes system (Italy). The best performing features were derived from Water Adjusted Vegetation Index (WAVI) computed at: early spring, maximum growth, and late autumn conditions. Overall accuracy (OA) and Kappa coefficient (k) of macrophyte maps produced with our approach over the ensemble of four sites were 90.1{\%} and 0.865, respectively, with best performance in European temperate areas (OA = 93.6-94.2{\%}, k= 0.887-0.916), and lower scores for subtropical Lake Taihu (OA = 82.8{\%}, k=. 0.762). Per-class accuracies were higher than 80{\%} for all target classes, except for the submerged-floating association, with misclassifications concentrated in Taihu site. The robustness of the approach was tested over two independent validation cases: a different site (i.e. Lake Varese, Italy), and a different input dataset (i.e. AVNIR-2 data, for Mantua Lakes system). Consistent accuracy results were achieved: OA = 94.3{\%} (k= 0.922) and OA = 85.6{\%} (k= 0.766), with some misclassification due to spatial resolution of AVNIR-2 data.},

abstract = {In the Laurentian Great Lakes, the prolific growth of submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV, dominated by the filamentous green alga Cladophora) is negatively impacting human and wildlife health, fisheries, and aesthetic conditions. The distribution of Cladophora and similar SAV in the Great Lakes and how that has changed over recent decades has been unknown, and the magnitude of the current problem relative to historic growth is difficult to assess given the lack of field data and monitoring. Here, we present the first comprehensive map of SAV in the nearshore zone of the lower four Great Lakes, where 'nearshore' indicates the zone where the bottom reflectance is sufficient to characterize bottom substrate type, using primarily the visible bands of the Landsat TM sensor. Multiple spectral bands were combined to minimize the water-depth-dependent variance in lake bottom reflectance, and pixels were classified as dense vegetation, sparse vegetation or uncolonized substrate. Changes in vegetation cover and water clarity between the mid-1970s and present were also evaluated for several focus areas across the lakes utilizing historical Landsat TM and MSS imagery. The Landsat-based bottom classification achieved an overall accuracy of 83{\%} based on comparison to ground truth data. Lake-wide SAV cover ranged from 15{\%} (Lake Huron) to 40{\%} (Lake Ontario) of the mappable lake bottom based on detection depth. The total mapped area of vegetation corresponds to a conservative biomass estimate of 129 kilotonnes dry weight. The observed changes in the distribution of SAV over time indicate that increasing water clarity in the Lakes is expanding Cladophora habitat.},

abstract = {In this study, we analyzed the land use and land cover (LULC) change in a hydrologic basin in the western coast of central Mexico and its regional variation in carbon storage. Three thematic maps (1986, 2001 and 2017) were produced by using pixel-based unsupervised classification techniques of Landsat images. LULC maps for 2017, 2033 and 2050 were modeled using a Cellular Automata Markov chain, validating their predictive power using Kappa variations. The InVEST software was used to estimate the carbon stored in four reservoirs, analyzing their variations over time (1986–2050). Accuracy assessment for the classifications revealed satisfactory results with an Overall accuracy of 83{\%} and a Kappa coefficient of 0.76. Results show that the main landscape modifier was the exposed soils class increasing by 65{\%} its extent in 1986, with a net increase around 87,900 ha. The evergreen forest (EF) and the tropical dry forest (TDF) classes showed a decrease along the period analyzed, displaying a net loss of 57,200 ha and 47,200 ha, respectively. Projected land cover changes followed the same trend observed, with a decreasing tendency in the EF and TDF coverages as consequence of exposed soil class increase. This change implies a reduction in the estimated total carbon stock, decreasing from 362.9 Tg C in 1986, to 336.2 Tg C in 2017. According to our model, if the trend detected in this analysis continues, it is expected a reduction to 317.9 Tg C in 2050. This approach combining Cellular Automata and Markov chain analysis with the InVEST model provides elements to estimate changes on carbon storage resulting from landscape changes. It also allows the identification of potential changes in the selected land use classes, providing with technical elements that could help to decision makers to better maintain the ecological integrity of the drainage basin.},

abstract = {The understanding of surface dynamics of Lake Ngami, a part of Okavango river system is hindered by paucity of data. The aim of this study was to assess the lake surface dynamics using satellite imagery and in-situ data. Surface dynamics of Lake Ngami were monitored using remote sensing methods to complement the available inadequate in-situ measurements. Landsat imagery of the year 1979 to year 2016 were used. The Lake boundary was mapped using the Modified Normalised Difference Water Index (MNDWI), where use was made of Histogram thresholding segmentation method in extracting the water pixels. Remotely sensed actual evapotranspiration (ETa) was estimated using Simplified Surface Energy Balance (SSEB) Modelling Approach; while the satellite derived rainfall estimates were obtained from Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) 3B43V7 satellite imagery product. Precipitation and potential evaporation data from meteorological stations were used to correct the bias of the satellite products. The SSEB method involved the estimation of evaporation fraction using the MODIS Land Surface Temperature and Emissivity 8-day product (MOD11A2) and GLDAS 0.25° Potential Evapotranspiration version 2.1 for the estimation of potential evapotranspiration. The lake extraction process displayed good results with the average Kappa coefficient and overall accuracy of 0.93 and 96.6{\%}, respectively. The maximum extent of Lake Ngami was observed in the year 2012 at 272 km2. The ETa was found to be in range of 700 mm/year in dry regions to about 2000 mm/year in Okavango delta swamps. From the study, it was observed that after the 2009 flood-event, the precipitation occurring during the rainy season (October–March) at Angola Highlands had a positive relationship with the Lake Ngami surface area, with Pearson correlation of 0.70. Similar findings were noticed when the lake surface area trend was observed against the in-situ flow data at the Mohembo hydrometric station, which is the inflow of the Okavango delta. This suggests that since the floods of 2009, the precipitation in the Angola Highlands has a major influence in the surface dynamics of Lake Ngami.},

abstract = {The lake area of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) was identified using an automatic waterbody interpretation method. The spectral reflectance of water is much lower than that of other land-surface materials in remote sensing images. The method made use of this characteristic, and divided the lake area into pure water pixels and mixed pixels. In total, 4051 field-collected ground control points of the boundaries of the 17 lakes were used to calibrate and validate the method. The lake area changes from the 1980s to 2015 were also analyzed. It can deal with the mismatch between the grid image boundaries and vector real lake boundaries. Results indicate that it is necessary to consider this mismatch when identifying waterbodies based on remote sensing images, especially in the case of waterbodies with an irregular shape. The method can distinguish waterbodies from wetlands and glaciers, and the interpretation accuracy was improved. In 2015, 1177 lakes with an area larger than 1 km 2 were recorded; the total lake area of the QTP was 43873.6 km 2 . In general, the QTP lakes have expanded during the past several decades. The lake area has increased by 18.3{\%} from the 1980s to 2015. This indicates expansion in the Northern Tibetan Plateau and shrinkage in the southern region of the QTP. The changes of precipitation were the main reasons for lake area changes on the QTP. However, the increased glacier melt runoff played a dominant role in the upper regions of the Yalungzangbo and Yellow rivers. The method proposed herein can be easily applied to other studies to monitor waterbodies based on remote sensing images, especially in the case of large waterbodies.},

abstract = {This paper analyzes all changes that occurred to the Egyptian Lake Maryut in order to identify the best strategy for restoring it. Four scenes were used for change detection; three LANDSAT images (dated 15th of March 1991, 2nd of May 2004, and 22nd of May 2013), and the fourth scene was a SPOT-HRV image dated 16th of August 1995. Maximum likelihood classification (MLC) algorithm was used to classify the images. The next step used was to focus on land cover changes by using change detection comparison (pixel by pixel) and the cross tabulation technique to analyze changes for the four supervised classification images. The results indicated that severe land cover changes occurred in different land covers especially in the last few years that may be due to political and socio-economic problems. Finally, a modern method based on the Delphi technique was used to select the best restoration alternative for restoring the Lake Maryut. Results indicate that severe land cover changes have occurred. In addition, the most suitable restoration alternatives are pollution control for the eastern part of the lake and reopening closed parts in its western part.},

It is the second largest of the Egyptian northern coastal lakes along the Mediterranean coast. It has economic and environmental impacts on the nearby society of Kafr El-Sheikh, Egypt. ERDAS IMAGINE and ArcGIS software are used in this study for processing of the images and managing the database of each image. Different classification techniques are tested, the results showed that the maximum likelihood supervised classification technique was more accurate to monitor changes in the water bodies of the Lake. The method is applied to subsets of the Landsat TM, ETM+ and OLI/TIRS images acquired on 1984, 1990, 1998, 2003 and 2015, respectively. Five classes are detected including sea water, lake water, floating vegetation, sand bar and urban, and agriculture land. The results showed that the water bodies of the lake decreased by 44.97{\%} (14,503.68 ha), while floating vegetation area increased mostly by the same amount during the period from 1984 to 2015. This increase in floating vegetation is mainly due to discharging of agriculture wastes and municipal wastes in the lake without adequate treatment. The sea water has minor changes during the period of study. The agriculture area increased by 45.52{\%} (10,529.02 ha), while the sand bar and urban area decreased mostly by the same amount during the period from 1984 to 2015. Statistical models were developed using statistical tools. The models indicated that the water bodies of the lake will be reduced by 58.95{\%} (19,013.42 ha) in 2030. The results of the present study shall help the decision-makers to take the necessary measures to reduce the environmental risk and maintain the lake in order to sustain the lake water area against further reduction.},

abstract = {Small reservoirs represent a critical water supply to millions of farmers across semi-arid regions, but their hydrological modelling suffers from data scarcity and highly variable and localised rainfall intensities. Increased availability of satellite imagery provide substantial opportunities but the monitoring of surface water resources is constrained by the small size and rapid flood declines in small reservoirs. To overcome remote sensing and hydrological modelling difficulties, the benefits of combining field data, numerical modelling and satellite observations to monitor small reservoirs were investigated. Building on substantial field data, coupled daily rainfall-runoff and water balance models were developed for 7 small reservoirs (1–10 ha) in semi arid Tunisia over 1999–2014. Surface water observations from MNDWI classifications on 546 Landsat TM, ETM+ and OLI sensors were used to update model outputs through an Ensemble (n = 100) Kalman Filter over the 15 year period. The Ensemble Kalman Filter, providing near-real time corrections, reduced runoff errors by modulating incorrectly modelled rainfall events, while compensating for Landsat's limited temporal resolution and correcting classification outliers. Validated against long term hydrometric field data, daily volume root mean square errors (RMSE) decreased by 54{\%} to 31 200 m3 across 7 lakes compared to the initial model forecast. The method reproduced the amplitude and timing of major floods and their decline phases, providing a valuable approach to improve hydrological monitoring (NSE increase from 0.64 up to 0.94) of flood dynamics in small water bodies. In the smallest and data-scarce lakes, higher temporal and spatial resolution time series are essential to improve monitoring accuracy.},

@article{Veh2018,
abstract = {Several thousands of moraine-dammed and supraglacial lakes spread over the Hindu Kush Himalayan (HKH) region, and some have grown rapidly in past decades due to glacier retreat. The sudden emptying of these lakes releases large volumes of water and sediment in destructive glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs), one of the most publicised natural hazards to the rapidly growing Himalayan population. Despite the growing number and size of glacial lakes, the frequency of documented GLOFs is remarkably constant. We explore this possible reporting bias and offer a new processing chain for establishing a more complete Himalayan GLOF inventory. We make use of the full seasonal archive of Landsat images between 1988 and 2016, and track automatically where GLOFs left shrinking water bodies, and tails of sediment at high elevations. We trained a Random Forest classifier to generate fuzzy land cover maps for 2491 images, achieving overall accuracies of 91{\%}. We developed a likelihood-based change point technique to estimate the timing of GLOFs at the pixel scale. Our method objectively detected ten out of eleven documented GLOFs, and another ten lakes that gave rise to previously unreported GLOFs. We thus nearly doubled the existing GLOF record for a study area covering {\~{}} 10{\%} of the HKH region. Remaining challenges for automatically detecting GLOFs include image insufficiently accurate co-registration, misclassifications in the land cover maps and image noise from clouds, shadows or ice. Yet our processing chain is robust and has the potential for being applied on the greater HKH and mountain ranges elsewhere, opening the door for objectively expanding the knowledge base on GLOF activity over the past three decades.},

abstract = {This paper describes the development of a Global 3arc-second Water Body Map (G3WBM), using an automated algorithm to process multi-temporal Landsat images from the Global Land Survey (GLS) database. We used 33,890 scenes from 4 GLS epochs in order to delineate a seamless water body map, without cloud and ice/snow gaps. Permanent water bodies were distinguished from temporal water-covered areas by calculating the frequency of water body existence from overlapping, multi-temporal, Landsat scenes. By analyzing the frequency of water body existence at 3arc-second resolution, the G3WBM separates river channels and floodplains more clearly than previous studies. This suggests that the use of multi-temporal images is as important as analysis at a higher resolution for global water body mapping. The global totals of delineated permanent water body area and temporal water-covered area are 3.25 and 0.49millionkm2 respectively, which highlights the importance of river-floodplain separation using multi-temporal images. The accuracy of the water body classification was validated in Hokkaido (Japan) and in the contiguous United States using an existing water body databases. There was almost no commission error, and about 70{\%} of lakes {\textgreater}1km2 shows relative water area error {\textless}25{\%}. Though smaller water bodies ({\textless}1km2) were underestimated mainly due to omission of shoreline pixels, the overall accuracy of the G3WBM should be adequate for larger scale research in hydrology, biogeochemistry, and climate systems and importantly includes a quantification of the temporal nature of global water bodies.},

abstract = {Satellite remote sensing can be considered a suitable approach to monitor the extent of cyanobacterial blooms compared with conventional ship surveys because of the patchiness and high spatial and temporal variability of the blooms. However, most of the existing algorithms are not capable of distinguishing cyanobacterial blooms and aquatic macrophytes due to their similar spectral characteristics in the red and near infrared (NIR) wavelengths. In this study, we conducted in situ spectral measurements and satellite data analyses for cyanobacterial blooms and aquatic macrophytes to find an effective method to distinguish them using medium-resolution Landsat satellite images. The reflectance spectra were measured for lake waters and cyanobacterial blooms with 13 different chlorophyll-a concentration levels (from 54 to 21,736$\mu$gL-1) and four types of aquatic macrophytes (two emerged and two floating-leaved macrophytes) in the wavelength range from 350 to 2500nm. In addition, seven Landsat images were collected for nine lakes in Japan or Indonesia. We calculated several selected indices, i.e., the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), five types of normalized difference water index (NDWI), and the floating algal index (FAI) to find an appropriate index for distinguishing cyanobacterial blooms and aquatic macrophytes.The results showed that the spectral characteristics of cyanobacterial blooms were significantly different from those of aquatic macrophytes in the short-wave infrared (SWIR) region, indicating that the SWIR bands are important for distinguishing cyanobacterial blooms and aquatic macrophytes. The results also showed that the combination of FAI and NDWI4,5 was an effective method for classifying lake areas. We first used the FAI for extracting lake waters, and we then used the NDWI4,5 to classify the remaining areas as cyanobacterial blooms or aquatic macrophytes. The results also showed that the threshold of NDWI4,5 was less sensitive to the effects of both the atmosphere and mixed pixels compared to the other indices. Our application of the FAI threshold of 0.05 and the NDWI4,5 threshold of 0.63 to six lakes in Japan and Indonesia showed that the proposed method could successfully distinguish lake water, cyanobacterial blooms, and aquatic macrophytes.},

abstract = {The present study emphasizes the long-term (1992–2012) land alteration and its driving factors in the Tamiraparani sub-basin, south India. The multi-temporal landuse/land cover features were extracted from the Landsat images (TM and ETM+, 30 m resolution) using a supervised classification technique with maximum likelihood classifier. The extracted features were classified into various landuse/ land cover categories with level I classification scheme of NRSC, India. Six major landuse classes such as forest, settlement, barren land, water bodies, agricultural land and fallow land were recognized. The overall accuracy for the year 1992, 2002, and 2012 shows 85.55{\%}, 82.81{\%} and 83.59{\%} respectively. The overall Kappa coefficients for the datasets are near to 0.8, which indicates acceptable accuracy for landuse/ land cover classification. The results reveals that the spatial extent of forest, settlement and barren land has evolved in the past 20 years but, the water bodies, agricultural land and fallow land has reduced significantly. The reduction in agricultural land in the study area for the past 20 years is due to the combination of natural environment and socio-economic factors such as low rainfall in the plains, increased surface temperature, reduced soil moisture condition, high rate of evapo-transpiration, reduced water storage level in the reservoirs and ponds, and reduced vegetation cover. These factors are linked with climate change, it alters the socio-economic condition of the area, and such situation will affect the overall ecosystem in the Tamiraparani sub-basin in the near future.},

abstract = {In arid and semi-arid climatic areas, lakes are extremely essential for fragile ecological environment and regional sustainable development. Ebinur Lake is an important component of the ecological barrier of Junggar Basin, Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR), China. Due to the tremendous changes in Ebinur Lake and surrounding marshes during the last decades, Ebinur Lake becomes a representative ecological degradation region in northwestern China. The detection of the intra-annual variations of water body and its responses to changing environment are critical for regional ecological security and rehabilitation of degraded ecosystem. To extract more accurate water information using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data and further fill the gap of inter-month dynamic monitoring of Ebinur Lake, a new SAR water index (modified Sentinel 1A water index, MSWI) was proposed based on the relationship between normalized difference water index (NDWI) imageries and Sentinel 1A data. The dynamic thresholds of classification were selected using Otsu method and the results showed that the classification results were acceptable with the optimal overall accuracy of 99.94{\%} and kappa coefficient of 0.9971, respectively. We conduct a time series analysis of surface areas of Ebinur Lake using S1A data from February 9th, 2017 to February 4th, 2018. The maximum lake surface area was 965.29 km 2 in April 22nd, 2017, while the minimum value was 750.37 km 2 in September 1st, 2017, and the mean area was 831.51 km 2 . The seasonal variations showed the stages of “sharp rising” – “significant decreasing” – “gradual stabilizing” in the study period. The water surface area was highly correlated with inflow water volume (correlation coefficient = 0.72, P {\textless} 0.001). The variation of Ebinur Lake's water surface area is crucial to monitor the resulting eco-environmental impacts under the changing environmental conditions in the arid and semi-arid areas.},

As a consequence of the filling of the reservoir to its final height of 83m, approximately 1,076km2 of terrestrial and riparian ecosystems were flooded in Argentina and Paraguay. In order to evaluate the ecosystem loss due to this impounding, we generated two maps of land use/land cover from Landsat satellite images: 1987 (prior to the dam) and 2011 (after the final height was reached). We applied a post classification method and tested the gain, loss, and net change of natural and anthropic ecosystems in the study area with a cross tabulation matrix. Water bodies were the land cover type that showed the greatest degree of change, increasing 14.8{\%} between periods. This was in detriment of, primarily, wetlands by 7.5{\%}, grasslands by 4.0{\%}, and native forests by 2.8{\%}. However, sandbanks presented the highest probability of transition to another land class and, thus, correspond to the most vulnerable land cover in the study area. Also, we detected a differential ecosystem loss, both in type and magnitude, up and downstream of the dam. Our work is the first one to address ecosystem loss in the Yacyret{\'{a}} area and our results should help to improve management policies, such as the design of the current network of compensatory reserves.},

Derived thematic land cover maps showed that agricultural land increased from 2{\%} in 1973 to a 5{\%} in 1981 reaching up to 30{\%} in 2014, whereas the city's land area significantly (p {\textless} 0.05) increased between 1973 and 1994. However, water hyacinth constantly increased over time. The spatial and temporal resolution of Landsat images detected land cover changes and the proliferation of aquatic hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) in the Lake Chivero over time.},

abstract = {Total phosphorus (TP) is an important factor of eutrophication. The accurate monitoring of TP concentration is conducive to the management of water environments. To improve the accuracy of TP remote sensing inversion, this paper improved and studied the following three aspects. First, a new optical classification method was constructed to classify water into two different types. Compared with other classification methods, the proposed method can be more effective for improving the accuracy of TP inversion. Second, data regression analysis and fitting (DRF), back propagation neural network (BP) and random forest (RF) were used to build TP inversion models based on the different water type. The validation results indicated that the DRF performed best, with the highest precision for all water types, and was suitable for TP inversion. Finally, the performance of the classification and inversion algorithms on Sentinel-3 data was evaluated and one image was acquired for mapping the TP concentration in Taihu Lake. All in all, this study improves the accuracy of TP inversion by combining the new classification algorithm with DRF. This is significant for the development of class-based water quality parameter inversion algorithms for water color remote sensing, and this approach can be applied in the effective management and control of the eutrophication of lake environments.},

abstract = {The remote sensing of freshwater resources is increasingly becoming important, due to increased patterns of water use and the current or projected impacts of climate change and the rapid invasion by lethal water weeds. This study therefore sought to explore the potential of the recently-launched Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS sensor in mapping invasive species in inland lakes. Specifically, the study compares the performance of the newly-launched Landsat 8 sensor, with more advanced sensor design and image acquisition approach to the traditional Landsat-7 ETM+ in detecting and mapping the water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) invasive species across Lake Chivero, in Zimbabwe. The analysis of variance test was used to identify windows of spectral separability between water hyacinth and other land cover types. The results showed that portions of the visible (B3), NIR (B4), as well as the shortwave bands (Band 8, 9 and 10) of both Landsat 8 OLI and Landsat 7 ETM, exhibited windows of separability between water hyacinth and other land cover types. It was also observed that on the use of Landsat 8 OLI produced high overall classification accuracy of 72{\%}, when compared Landsat 7 ETM, which yielded lower accuracy of 57{\%}. Water hyacinth had optimal accuracies (i.e. 92{\%}), when compared to other land cover types, based on Landsat 8 OLI data. However, when using Landsat 7 ETM data, classification accuracies of water hyacinth were relatively lower (i.e. 67{\%}), when compared to other land cover types (i.e. water with accuracy of 100{\%}). Spectral curves of the old, intermediate and the young water hyacinth in Lake Chivero based on: (a) Landsat 8 OLI, and (b) Landsat 7 ETM were derived. Overall, the findings of this study underscores the relevance of the new generation multispectral sensors in providing primary data-source required for mapping the spatial distribution, and even configuration of water weeds at lower or no cost over time and space.},

abstract = {A considerable portion of the natural inland lakes has been gradually transformed into aquaculture ponds to meet the enormous demand for aquaculture products. The changes in ponds area can be used to measure the impact of human activities on inland lakes. However, aquaculture ponds and inland lakes are often intermingled with each other especially in the areas close to the lake shore, posing great difficulties for the extraction of aquaculture ponds from medium resolution (15–30 m) multispectral imagery, such as Landsat TM, OLI, and Geofen-1 WFV images. This study proposes a contour-based regularity measurement for water segments, which evaluates the zero-curvature portions of the boundaries, to distinguish aquaculture ponds from natural water. Water surfaces are firstly extracted from satellite images, and then boundary trace of each water segment is carried out to evaluate the geometrical feature of its contour, including perimeter, curvature and the proposed contour-based regularity. Eventually, SVM classification based on these geometrical features separates the aquaculture ponds from inland lakes. Experiments on Landsat TM, OLI, and Geofen-1 WFV images showed that the combination of perimeter, area and proposed contour-based regularity outperforms other feature combinations and produced the most accurate classification. Therefore, the proposed method can be used to extract all aquaculture ponds from all historic Landsat images to monitor the changes in inland aquaculture.},

abstract = {The protection and restoration of water-related ecosystems is one of the goals to be achieved by the United Nations' 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. In this framework and requested by government Argentine institutions concerned with water, biodiversity and territorial management, this study analyzes the evolution of the flooded area within the Dulce River wetlands and Mar Chiquita Lake Nature Reserve (centered around 30.6°S, 62.6°W, 70 m above sea level) in Argentina since 2003, when the historical maximum extent was reached, until 2017. The Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) was calculated on atmospherically corrected NASA Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (L5-TM) and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (L8-OLI) reflectance data over two-scene cloudless-sky mosaics to cover the whole Reserve. Mixed-water pixels constituted an important fraction of the total-water covered area, particularly during years of minimum water level in Mar Chiquita Lake. So, MNDWI values were analyzed along transects crossing two stable regional water bodies to determine precise thresholds for detection of non-water (MNDWI {\textless} −0.15 for L5-TM, MNDWI {\textless} −0.35 for L8-OLI), mixed-water (−0.15 {\textless} MNDWI {\textless} 0.4 for L5-TM, −0.35 {\textless} MNDWI {\textless} 0.5 for L8-OLI) and open-water (0.4 {\textless} MNDWI for L5-TM, 0.5 {\textless} MNDWI for L8-OLI) pixels. A higher spatial resolution image, SPOT5-HGR2, was used to validate the classification method. A confusion matrix was built which resulted in an overall accuracy of 99.2{\%} and a Kappa coefficient of 0.98. In-situ Geo-referenced photographic registers were also taken simultaneously to a Landsat 8 overpass to confirm the classification thresholds. The analysis of simulated MNDWI response, by using the assumption of the linear mixture model, showed that mixed pixels should present from 9{\%} to 76{\%} of detectable open-water area. Maximum total flooded area extensions of about 3600 km 2 by 2003–2005 and a minimum one of 2050 km 2 by the end of 2011 were established, followed by a recent trend to the recovering with a total flooded area of about 3400 km 2 in the period 2015–2017. Open-water covered area follows closely the behavior of in-situ water level measurements of Mar Chiquita Lake, showing a maximum in year 2003 and a minimum towards the end of 2013, in a significant linear relation from which a topographical slope of the terrain of about 0.012{\%} is inferred that agrees with previous bathymetric studies. Results show the powerful complement between a reliable water satellite monitoring tool and locally-measured parameters in so dynamic wetland regions.},

Using four decades of Landsat and HJ-1A/1B satellites observations and recently developed classification algorithms, long-term wetland changes in Poyang Lake, the largest freshwater lake of China, have been investigated in this study. In dry seasons, while the transitions from mudflat to vegetation and vice versa were comparable before 2001, vegetation area increased by 620.8km2 (16.6{\%} of the lake area) between 2001 and 2013. In wet seasons, although no obvious land cover changes were observed between 1977 and 2003, {\~{}}30{\%} of the Nanjishan Wetland National Nature Reserve (NWNNR) in the south lake changed from water to emerged plant during 2003 and 2014. The changing rate of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) in dry seasons showed that the vegetation in the lake center regions flourished, while the growth of vegetation in the off-water areas was stressed. Rapid NDVI increase was also found in the NWNNR in the wet seasons. The relationships between the water levels and vegetation coverage also showed two regimes in both dry and wet seasons for the pre-Three Gorges Dam (TGD) period (before 2003) and post-TGD period (after 2003). Analyses of long-term hydrological and meteorological data clearly indicated that while local precipitation remained stable, the water level of Poyang Lake decreased significantly after the impoundment of the TGD, which is likely the main reason for the wetland expansion in recent years.},

abstract = {Poyang Lake, the largest freshwater lake of China, is well known for its ecological importance as a dynamic wetland system. However, due to the significant seasonality of the lake's inundation area, no systematic study has assessed the wetland changes over the past few decades. We addressed this challenge by using four decades of Landsat observations ranging from 1973 to 2013. The images were acquired in the same season to ensure similar phenological and hydrological conditions during each year. Extensive training and validation samples were collected from high-resolution Quickbird imagery to develop a Support Vector Machines (SVM) method for wetland classification of Poyang Lake. To obtain consistent results from different Landsat instruments, an empirical line correction approach was introduced to adjust the sensor-associated differences in band configurations and spectral responses. Significant changes in the major wetland cover types in Poyang Lake were revealed from long-term classification maps. The vegetation coverage of Poyang wetland showed a statistically significant increasing trend during the overall period (15.9km2year-1), and the vegetation tended to spread into the lake center in the Nanjishan Wetland National Nature Reserve (NWNNR) in recent years. At the same time, out-of-phase variability was observed for the mudflats since 1984, with a significant shrinking trend of -12.1km2year-1 (p{\textless}0.05). Although sand coverage experienced a rapid decrease from 1973 to 1990 (from 544.3km2 to 62.9km2), it remained at a relative stable low level ({\textless}100km2) in the following period. The two national reserves in Poyang Lake shared change patterns similar to those of the entire lake. Although {\~{}}70{\%} of the long-term changes in the wetland vegetation area appeared to be explained by local temperature, there was rapid increase after 2002 possibly could be due to the impoundment of the Three Gorges Dam (TGD) in 2003. The large sand area in 1973 was potentially linked to previous human activities in China between the 1950s and the 1970s. The method used in this study could be easily extended to other places in the world to assess the decadal wetland changes, and the information provided in this work is critical for future restoration efforts of the Poyang Lake wetland ecosystem.},

For exploring wetland spatiotemporal variations in estuarine and coastal regions of the Yangtze River, we extracted wetland information from 40-year time-series images of Landsat, GF-1, and other satellites, using the classification method of decision tree. Potential environmental and socio-economic factors which may drive wetland variations were analyzed. Results show that the wetland area in Yangtze River estuary has increased 663 km2, but it was only contributed by the increasing of human-made wetlands (767 km2), which were mostly caused by economic growth and constructions of human-made hydro-projects in Yangtze Delta. In comparison, natural wetlands, such as tidal flats and marshes, have decreased 163 km2. Land reclamation has changed these natural wetlands into reservoirs, aquaculture ponds and paddy fields. Wetlands in Shanghai and Qidong urban regions were mainly affected by human activities, while wetland variations in Chongming Island were mainly controlled by natural factors such as the upstream discharge, precipitation, diurnal variation of tidal level and long-term sea level rising. The general trend is that the natural wetland was transformed into the human-made wetland, and the human-made wetland was transformed into construction land.},

abstract = {Knowledge about inland surface water distribution and its short- to long-term variability is of high importance. Recently many studies have presented interesting results at regional, continental and global scale with 14.25 m to 25 km spatial and 10 day to one year temporal resolution. However, surface inland water bodies can feature temporally rapid spatial changes caused by extreme events, seasonal variability as well as human activity. Such changes can occur on temporal scales which are below the currently existing dynamic water body products. While the daily temporal resolution of available sensors has not been exploited yet. In this study we present an approach which uses the full temporal resolution of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) to generate a 250 m daily global dataset of inland water bodies based on spectral information and dynamic thresholding. Based on a combination of MODIS Terra and Aqua daily classifications, auxiliary mask layers and temporal interpolation, a global cloud and gap free time series of inland water bodies is produced. The presented results are validated with 321 Landsat images across the globe. The executed validation shows an overall accuracy of 96.3{\%} with 7.8{\%} omission and 0.5{\%} commission error, and a kappa coefficient of 93.3{\%} for pure water pixels. The presented results demonstrate the high potential for different applications requiring information of inland water body dynamics at high temporal resolution. Examples demonstrate that e.g. the filling and emptying of water reservoirs, changes and inundation cycles of natural water bodies as well as freezing and thawing of lakes can be analyzed at a highly detailed temporal scale.},

abstract = {In the 21st century, global warming, erratic rainfall and the pressure on groundwater resources are becoming severe and leading to water scarcity, which contributes to the poverty of around one-third of the world's people. Hence, it became necessary to use new geospatial technologies for mapping and monitoring of groundwater resources. Spatial analysis of hydro-geological lineament network and hydrological modeling may allow accurate identification of areas that favor infiltration and recharge of overexploited groundwater. In Morocco, the Middle Atlas region suffers from a lack of reliable hydro-geological maps for local water resource managers. Consequently, this research aims to assess the relative contribution of the topo-hydrological factor, known as Height Above Nearest Drainage (HAND) for efficient exploration and management of groundwater resources in central Middle Atlas. The methodology was based on the Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data for retrieving the lineaments and the elevation data from Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) for the calculation of the HAND model. Four landscape classes namely, waterlogged land, wetlands sloped, hillslope and plateaus, corresponding to the main hydrological systems, were delineated using the HAND model. In addition, fissured carbonate plateaus, faults, karsts, water sources, lakes and groundwater levels have been used to develop a decision support system based on geospatial criteria analysis. The fracture analysis indicated that the study area has many long and short hydro-geological lineaments, with the highest densities oriented NE–SW. Their synergy with the HAND model and the other factors has allowed the detection of potential areas for the recharge of the groundwater table. The results have been confirmed and validated using lakes, water sources and piezometric levels. The application of the HAND factor as an independent variable in the delineation of groundwater potential areas (GPAs) is demonstrated to be useful for improving the accuracy of the existing multi-criteria GIS models.},

Researchers' insufficient understanding of the hydrological networks associated with lakes hampers studies of the relationship between lakes and climate. In this study, we establish a comprehensive hydrological network for each lake ({\textgreater}1 km2) on the TP using 106 Landsat images, 236 Chinese topographic maps, and SRTM DEM. Three-hundred-ninety-seven closed lakes, 488 upstream lakes and 317 outflow lakes totaling 3,5498.49 km2, 7,378.82 km2, and 3,382.29 km2, respectively, were identified on the TP using 2010 data. Two-hundred-thirty-four closed lakes were found to not be linked to upstream lakes. The remaining 163 closed lakes were connected to and fed by the 488 upstream lakes. The object-oriented analyses within this study indicated that more rapid changes occurred in the surface extent of closed lakes than in upstream lakes or outflow lakes on the TP from 1970 s to 2010. Furthermore, the water volume of the examined closed lakes was almost nine times greater than that of the upstream lakes from 2003 to 2009. All the examined closed lakes exhibited an obvious water volume change compared to the corresponding upstream lakes in the same basin. Furthermore, two case studies illustrate that the annual and seasonal dynamics associated with the changes in closed lakes may reflect climate change patterns, while the upstream lake dynamics may be more controlled by the lakeshore terrain and drainage characteristics. The lake inventory and hydrological network catalogued in this study provide a basis for developing a better understanding of lake response to climate change on the TP.},

abstract = {Land use and land cover (LULC) changes are continuous phenomena, often driven by natural and anthropogenic factors. In Ethiopia, a conversion of forest and grass lands into cultivated and urbanized lands has been reported. While such changes are known to have multidirectional impacts on river flows, erosion and sedimentation, and the socio-economic situation within a catchment, there is a lack of assessment on the scale and rate of these changes, and consequent impacts. This study quantifies the rate of LULC in the Gumara catchment (1413 km2), an important tributary to Lake Tana in northwest Ethiopia. Landsat images of three years (1986, 2001 and 2015) were processed using the supervised classification method. An extensive field survey generated over 150 ground truth points, which were used in the classification and accuracy assessment process. Then, a conceptual rainfall-runoff model (HBV) was calibrated and validated to assess the impacts of LULC changes on water balance components - evapotranspiration, soil moisture, groundwater recharge and runoff. Additionally, the decadal means and trends of precipitation and discharge were analysed to further examine and quantify the observed changes (if any). A reasonably reliable LULC classification was achieved, with an overall accuracy of 90{\%}. The results indicated that the catchment area under forest and grass land was about 11 and 18{\%}, respectively, in 1986, which reduced to 5 and 10{\%}, respectively, in 2015. In contrast, cultivated land increased from 70{\%} in 1986 to 82{\%} in 2015. Contrary to the expected impact of these LULC changes on hydrology, the HBV model, indicated only a slight change in the water balance components (±5{\%}). Runoff and all other water balance components remained more or less stable despite considerable LULC changes. However, the uncertainties encountered in the modelling process (e.g. model structure, LULC representation) could have masked the LULC impacts on hydrology. This was supported by the significant increase in the observed discharge indicated by the statistical analysis, even in view of no substantial changes in precipitation. Therefore, LULC could cause considerable increase in discharge, which needs further testing (e.g. through physically based modelling with detailed inclusion of LULC processes).},

abstract = {Water transparency is one of the ecological indicators for describing water quality and the underwater light field which determines its productivity. In the European Water Framework Directive (WFD) as well as in the European Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) water transparency is used for ecological status classification of inland, coastal and open sea waters and it is regarded as an indicator for eutrophication in Baltic Sea management (HELCOM, 2007). We developed and compared different empirical and semi-analytical algorithms for lakes and coastal Nordic waters to retrieve Secchi depth (ZSD) from remote sensing data (MERIS, 300 m resolution). The algorithms were developed in water bodies with high coloured dissolved organic matter absorption (aCDOM(442) ranging 1.7–4.0 m−1), Chl a concentration (0.5–73 mg m−3) and total suspended matter (0.7–37.5 g m−3) and validated against an independent data set over inland and coastal waters (0.6 m {\textless} ZSD {\textless} 14.8 m). The results indicate that for empirical algorithms, using longer wavelengths in the visible spectrum as a reference band decreases the RMSE and increases the coefficient of determination (R2). The accuracy increased (R2 = 0.75, RMSE = 1.33 m, n = 134) when ZSD was retrieved via an empirical relationship between ZSD and Kd(490). The best agreement with in situ data was attained when ZSD was calculated via both the diffuse and the beam attenuation coefficient (R2 = 0.89, RMSE = 0.77 m, n = 89). The results demonstrate that transparency can be retrieved with high accuracy over various optical water types by the means of ocean color remote sensing, improving both the spatial and temporal coverage. The satellite derived ZSD product could be therefore used as an additional source of information for WFD and MSFD reporting purposes.},

abstract = {Water is the most common and important resources on earth. In this paper, we tested and analyzed a variety of water indices for water surface extraction using Landsat TM/ETM+ images, and evaluated extraction accuracies over Ebinur Lake area in Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of China. Eleven algorithms found in literature on land surface water extraction, including normalized difference water index (NDWI), modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI), automatic water extraction index with no shadow (AWEInsh), automatic water extraction with shadow (AWEIsh), vegetation index 1 (VI-1), vegetation index 2 (VI-2), vegetation index 3 (VI-3), water index (LBV{\_}B), national wetland inventory (NWI), enhanced water index (EWI), and revised normalized different water index (RNDWI) were used. The results were validated by a maximum likelihood classification method, edge extraction accuracy assessment and extracted the area of Ebinur Lake from higher-resolution Landsat ETM+ panchromatic band. The results showed that these algorithms have different accuracies in extracting water information. We proposed VI-2 for KT3+ TM4{\textgreater}TM2+ TM7 and VI-3 for KT3+ TM2{\textgreater}TM4+ TM3 as an optimized and comprehensive method for land surface water extraction from Landsat TM/ETM+ Images (KT3, i.e. Wetness index from the Kauth-Thomas Transformation). The proposed VI-2 and VI-3 models demonstrated its potential in water body extraction with 92.95{\%} and 85.04{\%} accuracies, outperforming other algorithms. Using the optimal mask water model, the two models achieved up to 93.80{\%} accuracy while minimizing the disturbance from vegetation and non-exploited land. Through comparison with other commonly used methods, it shows that the performance of the proposed method is superior to the others. Therefore VI-2 and VI-3 are the best indicators for water mapping using Landsat TM/ETM+ images. This study provided its great potential for quantitative evaluating of temporal changes of Ebinur Lake in Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of China.},

abstract = {Change in water supply and drainage patterns of surface and subsurface moisture zones are greatly enhanced due to anthropogenic activities. Monitoring changing wetland ecosystems helps to determine their tolerance to such anthropogenic activities. Sultanpur National Park, a wetland ecosystem located in Gurgaon district of Haryana state is such an ecosystem, harbouring plant and animal biodiversity. Increase in agriculture and builtup area in the surrounding region along with artificial deepening of the lake area for rainwater accumulation has led to the degradation of the central lake both in terms of quantity and quality. The anthropogenic influence was validated by landuse landcover mapping (through K-means unsupervised classification) of LANDSAT data within the wetland catchment for year 2000 and 2015 having an overall accuracy of 89.45{\%} for 2000 and 80.48{\%} for 2015. A declining trend in the total area under water cover in postmonsoon with a final area reduction of {\~{}}66{\%} was observed from the year 1995–2015. Rampant agriculture and builtup land adjacent to the lake as well as artificial pumping of groundwater are major reasons for the deterioration of the lake water quality further posing major threats to the wetland ecosystem. Siltation from erosion and surface runoff due to mining and agriculture have led to the input of ionic components resulting in lake water quality deterioration as well as reduction in the depth of the lake available for rainwater accumulation. It has been inferred that high concentrations of nitrate (50{\%} of samples above permissible limit ({\textgreater} 45 ppm)) and phosphate (50{\%} of samples above permissible limit ({\textgreater} 0.1 ppm)) ions within the lake water is due to input from surface run off from the surrounding agricultural cropland within the lake catchment further leading to lake eutrophication and habitat loss suitable for plant and animal biodiversity.},

Both pre-classification and post classification change detection approach was used to assess the change result from 1980 to 2010. In pre-classification approach CVA, NDVI and NDWI analysis were implemented to assess the change scenario. Maximum likelihood supervised classification technique was performed to create the signature class of significant land cover category (deep water, shallow water, vegetation, and settlement). After ensuring satisfactory accuracy value for each classified image a detail post classification change detection analysis was executed. Image differencing, statistical change detection techniques (transition probability matrix), change dynamics analysis was also operated to evaluate the statistics of past change relative to present. This study illustrated that, about 40{\%} land cover of the total study area has been converted over 30 years period. Forested and high land vegetation's are disappearing rapidly, deep water bodies consist of large lakes are becoming the rare feature of the study area.

As such we conducted a case study of the Santo Ant{\^{o}}nio and Jirau mega dams on the Madeira River in Rond{\^{o}}nia, Brazil and used Landsat TM and OLI data to determine area covered by water along a 539 km stretch of the Madeira River from 2006 to 2015 (covering before and after the dams' construction). The classification method used in this study was modified based off of previous methods and provided a highly accurate water classification suggesting it to be a valuable way of accurately classifying water along with other land cover classes. We compared the water areas calculated from Landsat land cover maps to the environmental impact assessment estimations used to approve the dams' construction. This analysis showed the reservoirs to be at least 341 km2 (64.5{\%}) larger than predicted with an additional 102 km2 of unpredicted flooding outside of the planned reservoir areas and 160 km2 more natural forest flooded than expected.},

abstract = {Several remote sensing studies have documented widespread thermokarst lake expansion in continuous permafrost regions of North America over the past few decades. Other studies have found no long-term trends in water body extents, but large intra- and inter-annual changes driven by precipitation. These differences could be due to geographic variability in physical conditions (geology, climate, permafrost and hydrology) or in the data and methods used to extract water bodies. This study tested water extraction methods over the Tuktoyaktuk Coastal Plain, Northwest Territories (NWT), Canada, based on the Landsat 5 shortwave infrared (SWIR) channel and validated them using water extents obtained from 0.5m resolution orthophoto imagery. Methods included applying thresholds to generate binary land/water classifications, as well as deriving 30m water fractions from both linear unmixing and a new histogram breakpoint method. Results indicated that the histogram breakpoint method outperformed other methods, underestimating overall water fraction by 0.26{\%} and overestimating the number of pure 30m water pixels by 0.66{\%} compared to water fractions calculated from orthophotos. The breakpoint method was then applied to a stack of 17 near peak-of-season Landsat 5 and Landsat 7 images acquired between July 4 and August 18 from 1985 to 2011 to create a water fraction time-series for examining both trends and inter-annual variation in water extent. Results showed an overall expansion of lake area along margins by 55km{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} with isolated lakes experiencing rapid drainage totalling 15km{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}, leading to a net water area increase of 40km{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} over the 26-year period.},

abstract = {Annual analyses of land cover dynamics in urban areas provide a thorough understanding of the urbanization effects on environment and valuable information for the improvement of urban growth modeling. However, most current studies focus on major land cover changes, such as urbanization and vegetation loss. The most feasible way to evaluate the complex interactions among different land cover types is the post-classification change detection, but the temporal inconsistency in the time series of land cover maps impedes the high-frequency and long-term analyses. This study proposed a spatio-temporal land cover filter (STLCF) to remove the illogical land cover change events in the time series of land cover maps, and analyzed the annual land cover dynamics in urban areas. The knowledge of illogical land cover change events was ‘learned' from the land cover maps through the spatio-temporal transition probability matrix, instead of experts' knowledge. The illogical change was modified with the land cover of the maximum probability calculated from the na{\"{i}}ve Bayesian equation. The STLCF was tested in Wuhan, a typical densely urbanized Chinese city. The annual land cover maps from 2000 to 2013 were derived from multi-date Landsat images using the Decision Tree (DT) classifier. Results showed that the STLCF improved the mean overall accuracy of annual change detection by about 6{\%}. Additionally, the amount of land cover trajectories with unrealistically frequent changes was significantly decreased. During the study period, 7.86{\%} of the pixels experienced one land cover change, and about 0.57{\%} of the pixels experienced land cover changes more than once. The annual analyses demonstrated the non-linear increasing trend in urbanization as well as the corresponding trend in vegetation loss in the study area. We also found the conversion from built-up areas to vegetation near rivers and lakes and in the reserves and rural areas, mainly caused by the restoration of built-up areas to the park or green belt/wedges along rivers and new roads in the metropolitan areas, and to the cropland and woods in the rural areas. Results of this study showed the importance of the spatio-temporal consistency check with knowledge derived from land cover maps of the study area, which facilitates the annual analyses of major and subtle land cover dynamics in urban areas.},

These lakes host a rich heritage of biodiversity that is endangered by recent drastic hydrologic changes due to multiple natural and anthropogenic stressors in the catchment areas of some of the lakes. This study utilized Landsat TM, ETM+, and OLI data to conduct a systematic investigation of the relationship between hydrological dynamics in the basins of four Rift Valley lakes (Nakuru, Baringo, Bogoria, and Elementaita) and recent land cover and land-use change. The Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) proved to be more accurate and robust for delineating water surface areas when compared to the output of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and classification algorithms. NDVI was successful when delineating water surface at Lake Baringo but not in Lakes Bogoria, Nakuru, and Elementaita, whose surfaces were dominated by algae. All the lakes expanded substantially after 2010 submerging surrounding areas leading to disruption of livelihoods, property damage, and displacement of thousands of people. The recent drastic hydrologic changes have multiple causations including land cover and land use change, increase in rainfall, and possible change in geogenic water input due to tectonic activity. The rapid rise in water levels appears to have altered the biogeochemical balance of the hypersaline lakes with severe ramifications on the rich biodiversity that is supported by the lakes.},

abstract = {a b s t r a c t Cyanobacterial bloom is a growing environmental problem in inland waters. In this study, we propose a method for monitoring levels of cyanobacterial blooms from Landsat/ETM+ images. The visual cyanobac-teria index (VCI) is a simple index for in-situ visual interpretation of cyanobacterial blooms levels, by classifying them into six categories based on aggregation (e.g., subsurface blooms, surface scum). The floating algae index (FAI) and remote sensing reflectance in the red wavelength domain, which can be obtained from Landsat/ETM+ images, were related to the VCI for estimating cyanobacteria bloom levels from the Landsat/ETM+ images. Nine field campaigns were carried out at Lakes Nishiura and Kitaura (Lake Kasumigaura group), Japan, from June to August 2012. We also collected reflectance spectra at 20 stations for different VCI levels on August 3, 2012. The reflectance spectra were recalculated in correspondence to each ETM+ band, and used to calculate the FAI. The FAI values were then used to determine thresholds for classifying cyanobacterial blooms into different VCI levels. These FAI thresholds were validated using three Landsat/ETM+ images. Results showed that FAI values differed significantly at the respective VCI levels except between levels 1 and 2 (subsurface blooms) and levels 5 and 6 (surface scum and hyper-scum). This indicated that the FAI was able to detect the high level of cyanobacteria that forms surface scum. In contrast, the Landsat/ETM+ band 3 reflectance could be used as an alternative index for dis-tinguishing surface scum and hyperscum. Application of the thresholds for VCI classifications to three Landsat/ETM+ images showed that the volume of cyanobacterial blooms can be effectively classified into the six VCI levels.},

abstract = {Due to its negative impacts on land productivity and plant growth, soil salinization is a significant problem particularly in arid and semi-arid regions of the world. Among the natural factors of soil salinization, parent materials including high amount of salts and minerals in soil structure, known as primary salinization, can be addressed. Conventional irrigation techniques and poor drainage systems are predominant human-induced activities that result in secondary salinization. Countries with especially dryland environment, face difficulty in providing adequate food for their rapidly increasing population since each year lots of cultivated land are abandoned due to adverse effects of primary and secondary soil salinization. Therefore, monitoring, mapping and predicting soil salinization is of utmost importance regarding lessening and/or preventing further increase in soil salinity through some protective measures. The subject of concern becomes even more pronounced particularly in agricultural lands as is the case in the vicinity of Tuz (Salt) Lake Region in Turkey. This research focuses mainly on multi-temporal monitoring of Tuz Lake Region in order to track changes in areas of salty spots in years 1990, 2002, 2006, 2011 and 2015. A total number of 25 Landsat-5 TM and Landsat-8 images obtained between 1990 and 2015 were analysed in this study. Field electrical conductivity (EC) measurements for 322 soil samples in year 2002 were checked; and 28 of these samples were selected for generating salinity maps representing areas in the vicinity of the lake. All satellite images were radiometrically and atmospherically corrected prior to classification. Following the pre-processing step, five soil salinity indices were applied on all satellite images. 28 soil samples were then overlaid on images in order to extract the exact index values related to soil samples and regression approach was used to relate satellite image-derived salinity indices and field measurements. Linear and exponential regression analyses were conducted separately as the next step for all indices based on data gathered in 2002. Salinity index (SI) 1 = B1*B3 showed the best result with R2 value of 0.93 and 0.83 for exponential and linear regression analysis, respectively. Salinity maps for years 1990, 2006, 2011 and 2015 were further produced utilizing the exponential and linear regression expressions attained for year 2002. Besides, this study detected land cover changes in the area from year 2000–2006, and from 2006 to 2012 by using CORINE land cover data to analyse the possible relationships between land cover change and salinity changes.},

To bridge the gap between these scales, we compiled an inventory of sediment and bedrock coverage from field mapping, remote sensing analysis and published data for five key sites in the Upper Rhone Basin (Val d'Illiez, Val de la Li{\`{e}}ne, Turtmanntal, L{\"{o}}tschental, Goms; 360.3 km2, equivalent to 6.7{\%} of the Upper Rhone Basin). This inventory was used as training and testing data for the classification of sediment and bedrock cover. From a digital elevation model (2 × 2 m ground resolution) and Landsat imagery we derived 22 parameters characterizing local morphometry, topography and position, contributing area, and climatic and biotic factors on different spatial scales, which were used as inputs for different statistical models (logistic regression, principal component logistic regression, generalized additive model). Best prediction results with an excellent performance (mean AUROC: 0.8721 ± 0.0012) and both a high spatial and non-spatial transferability were achieved applying a generalized additive model. Since the model has a high thematic consistency, the independent input variables chosen based on their geomorphic relevance are suitable to model the spatial distribution of sediment. Our high-resolution classification shows that 53.5 ± 21.7{\%} of the Upper Rhone Basin are covered with sediment. These are by no means evenly distributed: small headwaters ({\textless} 5 km2) feature a very strong variability in sediment coverage, with watersheds drowning in sediments juxtaposed to watersheds devoid of sediment cover. In contrast, larger watersheds predominantly show a bimodal distribution, with highest densities for bedrock (30–40{\%}) being consistently lower than for sediment cover (60–65{\%}). Earlier studies quantifying sedimentary cover and volume focus on the broad glacially overdeepened Rhone Valley that accounts for c. 9{\%} of our study area. While our data support its importance, we conservatively estimate that the remaining 90{\%} of sediment cover, mainly located outside trunk valleys, account for a volume of 2.6–13 km3, i.e. 2–16{\%} of the estimated sediment volume stored in the Rhone Valley between Brig and Lake Geneva. Furthermore, our data reveal increased relative sediment cover in areas deglaciated since the Little Ice Age, as compared to headwater regions without this recent glacial imprint. We therefore conclude that sediment storage in low-order valleys, often neglected in large scale studies, constitutes a significant component of large scale sediment budgets that needs to be better included into future analysis.},

abstract = {The ability of medium-resolution (10–30 m) satellite imagery to delineate the size and persistence of ponds on debris-covered glaciers is a topic of recent interest as it has become apparent through the use of fine-resolution products that smaller ponds have often been neglected. In this study, we performed a quantitative analysis of pond detection using a normalised difference water index (NDWI) applied to several widely used satellite sensors, which offer multispectral information at high radiometric precision. These data include: RapidEye (5 m spatial resolution), Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument (MSI) (10–20 m), and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) multispectral imagery (30 m). We demonstrate a method to derive an optimum NDWI value for pond classification using a subset reference dataset of 285 ponds classified using fine-resolution (0.5 m) imagery. We then applied the optimised NDWI (NDWI-O) to the remaining images to assess pond classification accuracy against a broader reference dataset of 898 ponds. NDWI values calculated using Sentinel-2 imagery showed the best spectral contrast between water and surrounding debris cover, and the strongest relationship with pixel water content (R2 = 0.56), followed by the RapidEye NDWI (R2 = 0.45). We conclude that RapidEye and Sentinel-2 imagery is best suited for accurate pond classification using a multispectral classification approach, which is important for quantifying their role in glacier ablation, meltwater regulation, and lake development. By comparison, the impact of using coarse-resolution Landsat 8 imagery to characterise surface water dynamics is minimised when applied to large glacier lakes, where the area-to-perimeter ratio is greater.},

abstract = {Lack of long-term scientific land cover and erosional data impedes the development of sustainable land management plans to tackle land degradation and soil erosion problems in Tanzania. Using Landsat imagery, almost three decades of land cover change in the Lake Manyara catchment (1988–2016) was reconstructed. Data highlight that the major land cover types are highly dynamic and that there is a net conversion of natural or semi-natural land cover towards agricultural uses. Specifically, the biggest net declining cover types were found to be ‘bushland', 'seasonal grassland' and ‘permanent savanna', which have reduced by 8.7, 6.1 and 3.5{\%} respectively. In this context an erosion risk model, based on the ‘Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation', was applied to evaluate how changing land cover has affected risk of surface soil erosion by water. Model outputs indicate that a lot of land conversion has occurred in areas that are naturally vulnerable due to topography, soil type and rainfall patterns, seriously increasing the soil erosion risk. The resulting output maps can be particularly useful in pinpointing potential areas of increased erosion risk underpinning targeted investigation and management action to support soil conservation for improved food and water security.},

abstract = {Monitoring of the alpine lakes on the endorheic Changtang Plateau is vitally important in understanding climate impacts on hydrological cycle. Existing studies have revealed an accelerated lake expansion on the Changtang Plateau during the 2000s compared with prior decades. However, the partial hiatus of recent Landsat archive affected the continuation of understanding the lake changes in the recent decade. Here we synergistically used imagery from Landsat and Huanjing satellites to enable a detailed monitoring of lake area dynamics on the Changtang Plateau. Our results present that lakes on the Changtang Plateau continued to expand at a rapid rate of 340.79 km2 yr−1 (1.06{\%} yr−1, p {\textless} 0.05) from 2009 to 2014. Changes in endorheic (terminal) lakes contribute to 98{\%} of the net expansion, suggesting that monitoring endorheic lake dynamics is of critical importance for understanding climate changes. Meanwhile, changes in saline lakes, which are mostly endorheic, account for 96{\%} of the net expansion, implying that the proportion of freshwater storage on the Changtang Plateau is likely in decline. Rapid expansion occurred in both glacier-fed and non-glacier-fed lakes, with a rate of 224.94 km2 yr−1 (0.92{\%} yr−1, p {\textless} 0.05) and 115.85 km2 yr−1 (1.47{\%} yr−1, p = 0.08), respectively, indicating that glacier retreat alone may not fully explain the recent lake expansion. Intra-annual variations of the selected 24 large lakes fluctuated within 0.22–2.46{\%} (in coefficient of variation) for glacier-fed lakes and 0.17–2.36{\%} for non-glacier-fed lakes. Most of these lakes expanded during the unfrozen period (from May/June to October) and reached to their maximum extents in September or October. By spatially associating our revealed lake changes with climate variables, we observed that the recent lake expansion is more related to precipitation than to temperature, although future efforts are needed for a more comprehensive picture of the lake changing mechanisms.},

abstract = {In situ reflectance measurements and Landsat satellite imagery were combined to develop an optical classification scheme for alkaline-saline lakes in the Eastern Rift Valley. The classification allows the ecological state and consequent value, in this case to Lesser Flamingos, to be determined using Landsat satellite imagery. Lesser Flamingos depend on a network of 15 alkaline-saline lakes in East African Rift Valley, where they feed by filtering cyanobacteria and benthic diatoms from the lakes' waters. The classification developed here was based on a decision tree which used the reflectance in Landsat ETM+ bands 2-4 to assign one of six classes: low phytoplankton biomass; suspended sediment-dominated; microphytobenthos; high cyanobacterial biomass; cyanobacterial scum and bleached cyanobacterial scum. The classification accuracy was 77{\%} when verified against in situ measurements. Classified imagery and timeseries were produced for selected lakes, which show the different ecological behaviours of these complex systems. The results have highlighted the importance to flamingos of the food resources offered by the extremely remote Lake Logipi. This study has demonstrated the potential of high spatial resolution, low spectral resolution sensors for providing ecologically valuable information at a regional scale, for alkaline-saline lakes and similar hypereutrophic inland waters.},

abstract = {Freshwater availability is critical for human survival, and in the Saharo-Arabian desert belt repeated fluctuations between aridity and humidity over the Quaternary mean the distribution of freshwater was likely a primary control upon routes and opportunities for hominin dispersals. However, our knowledge of the spatio-temporal distribution of palaeohydrological resources within Arabia during Mid-Late Pleistocene episodes of climatic amelioration remains limited. In this paper we outline a combined method for remotely mapping the location of palaeodrainage and palaeolakes in currently arid regions that were formerly subject to more humid conditions. We demonstrate the potential of this approach by mapping palaeochannels across the whole Arabian Peninsula, and palaeolakes and marshes for select regions covering c. 10{\%} of its surface. Our palaeodrainage mapping is based upon quantitative thresholding of HydroSHEDs data, which applies flow routing to Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data, while our palaeolake mapping uses an innovative method where spectral classification of Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery is used to detect palaeolake deposits within endorheic (closed) basins, before modelling maximum lake extents by flooding the basin to the level of the elevation of the highest detected deposit. Field survey in the Nefud desert and the Dawadmi and Shuwaymis regions of Saudi Arabia indicates accuracies of 86{\%} for palaeodrainage mapping, and 96{\%} for identifying former palaeolake basins (73{\%} accuracy of classification of individual deposits). The palaeolake mapping method has also demonstrated potential for identifying surface and stratified archaeological site locations, with 76{\%} of the surveyed palaeolake basins containing archaeological material, including stratified Palaeolithic archaeology. Initial examination of palaeodrainage in relation to archaeological sites indicates a relationship between mapped features and previously recorded Palaeolithic sites. An example of the application of these data for period-specific regional palaeohydrological and archaeological reconstructions is presented for a region of Northern Saudi Arabia covering the southern Nefud desert and adjacent lava fields.},

abstract = {Land use and land cover (LULC) change has been recognized as a key driver of global climate change by influencing land surface processes. Being in constant change, river basins are always subjected to LULC changes, especially decline in forest cover to give way for agricultural expansion, urbanization, industrialization etc. We used on-screen digital interpretation technique to derive LULC maps from Landsat images at three decadal intervals i.e., 1985, 1995 and 2005 of two major river basins of India. Rain-fed, Mahanadi river basin (MRB) attributed to 55{\%} agricultural area wherein glacier-fed, Brahmaputra river basin (BRB) had only 16{\%} area under agricultural land. Though conversion of forest land for agricultural activities was the major LULC changes in both the basins, the rate was higher for BRB than MRB. While water body increased in MRB could be primarily attributed to creation of reservoirs and aquaculture farms; snow and ice melting attributed to creation of more water bodies in BRB. Scrub land acted as an intermediate class for forest conversion to barren land in BRB, while direct conversion of scrub land to waste land and crop land was seen in MRB. While habitation contributed primarily to LULC changes in BRB, the proximity zones around habitat and other socio-economic drivers contributed to LULC change in MRB. Comparing the predicted result with actual LULC of 2005, we obtained {\textgreater}97{\%} modelling accuracy; therefore it is expected that the Dyna-CLUE model has very well predicted the LULC for the year 2025. The predicted LULC of 2025 and corresponding LULC changes in these two basins acting as early warning, and with the past 2-decadal change analysis this study is believed to help the land use planners for improved regional planning to create balanced ecosystem, especially in a changing climate.},

abstract = {Spatially detailed characterization of the distribution, amount and timing of river ice is important for identifying and predicting potential ice hazards. Although information on the ice cover over inland water bodies is provided within MODIS snow products (MOD10 and MYD10), this information has little practical value for river ice monitoring. First, many rivers are not properly resolved in the MODIS land/water mask. Second, the cloud mask incorporated in the product is conservative and therefore results in reduced effective area coverage of the product. Third, the accuracy of the incorporated cloud mask (MOD35) depends on the particular setting and underlying land/water mask. The MODIS cloud mask is not suitable for this particular setting, if frequent ice observations are desired. In this study we present an alternative river ice monitoring algorithm for MODIS that identifies river ice both in cloud-free conditions and through some semitransparent clouds. As input the semitransparent cloud algorithm (STC) uses an improved land/water mask accurately delineating the river channel along with bands 4 and 7 data from the MODIS surface reflectance product. The algorithm was developed for the MODIS instrument and comprehensively tested with MODIS Aqua data over the Lower Susquehanna River for the 2014 winter season. It is shown that river ice cover retrievals made with STC are highly consistent with in situ observed ice processes, for both individual scenes and the overall winter period. Owing to a better-suited cloud masking algorithm, the new technique yields nearly twice as many usable river observations during the ice-bearing period as compared to the MODIS cloud cover product. The presented approach provides potential for more timely identification of river ice changes and hence more accurate prediction of ice-related hazards using MODIS data.},

Satellite image classification problem has two major concerns to be addressed. The first issue is mixed pixel problem and the second issue is handling large amount of data present in these images. RBFNN function is an efficient network with a large set of tunable parameters. This network is able to generalize the results and is immune to noise. A RBFNN has learning ability and can appropriately react to unseen data. This makes the network a good choice for satellite images. The efficiency of RBFNN is greatly influenced by the learning algorithm and seed point selection. Therefore, in this paper spectral indices are used for seed selection and GA is used to train the network. The proposed method is used to classify the Landsat 8 OLI images of Dongting Lake in South China. The application of this method is shown for detection of flooded area over this region. The performance of the proposed method was analyzed and compared with three existing methods and the error matrix was computed to test the performance of the method. The method yields high producer's accuracy, consumer's accuracy and kappa coefficient value which indicated that the proposed classifier is highly effective and efficient.},

In this study, spatial filters based on several a priori information are proposed to reduce noise and perform spatial interpolation to fill missing-data in satellite-based surface water maps such as wetlands, rivers, lakes. Four main sources of a priori of information are considered: (1) historical information at the pixel level, (2) neighbouring information constraints based on a historical record, (3) constraints based on topography, and (4) hydrological constraints based on a floodability index. Experiments are conducted over synthetic but realistic data, as well as over real Sentinel 1 (SAR) and 2 (visible) water map retrievals. Mis-classification quantitative results over these three types of data show that simple determinist spatial filters allow reducing noise and filling missing-data. The four sources of a priori information can be exploited and combined to improve observed water maps. This opens some ways to develop post-processing tools for improving surface water maps at high spatial resolution from missions such as SWOT (Surface Water and Ocean Topography) to be launched in 2020.},

It is one of the northern coastal lakes in Egypt, located at the northwestern part of the Nile Delta. Edku Lake is an important fishing area in Egypt and receives its water from two sources. One of sources is the drainage water of Kom Belag and Bersik drains and second is the sea water. Remote sensing and GIS software are used in this study for processing of the images and managing the database of each image. The different techniques of classification were tested, the results showed that the maximum likelihood supervised classification technique was more accurate to monitor changes in the water bodies of the Lake. The technique was applied to subsets of the Landsat TM, ETM+ and OLI/TIRS images acquired on 1984, 1990, 1998, 2003 and 2015, respectively to monitor changes in the Lake. The results showed that the water bodies of the lake decreased during the period from 1984 to 2015. The extracted data from the images have been used to develop statistical models for the different classes to predict the future situation of each class. The results of prediction indicated that the water body of the lake will be more decrease in 2030. The results indicate that the water body of the lake is not sustainable. The results of this study will act as warning for the decision makers to take the necessary actions/policy to reduce the environmental risk and maintain the healthy environment of the lake.},

abstract = {The dynamics of supraglacial pond development in the Everest region are not well constrained at a glacier scale, despite their known importance for meltwater storage, promoting ablation, and transmitting thermal energy englacially during drainage events. Here, we use fine-resolution ({\~{}}. 0.5-2 m) satellite imagery to reveal the spatiotemporal dynamics of 9340 supraglacial ponds across nine glaciers in the Everest region. Six of our nine study glaciers displayed a net increase in ponded area over their observation periods. However, large inter- and intra-annual changes in ponded area were observed of up to 17{\%} (Khumbu Glacier), and 52{\%} (Ama Dablam) respectively. Additionally, two of the fastest expanding lakes (Spillway and Rongbuk) partially drained over our study period. The Khumbu Glacier is developing a chain of connected ponds in the lower ablation area, which is indicative of a trajectory towards large lake development. We show that use of medium-resolution imagery (e.g. 30 m Landsat) is likely to lead to large classification omissions of supraglacial ponds, on the order of 15-88{\%} of ponded area, and 77-99{\%} of the total number of ponds. Fine-resolution imagery is therefore required if the full spectrum of ponds that exist on the surface of debris-covered glaciers are to be analysed.},

abstract = {In this study, we investigated whether environmental changes (climatic conditions, deforestation and surface water) in the woodland savanna and rain forest zones of Southwestern Nigeria, as observed by the rural communities' local experts', can be used to evaluate Land cover change (LCC) in the region. LCC was conducted using orthorectified Landsat multi-temporal imagery for 1970/1972, 1986/1987, 2000/2001 and 2006 using maximum likelihood classification and change detection techniques. The results showed a decrease in the forest area and an increase in built-up and cultivation/others (open space, bare land, grassland) areas. Between 1972 and 2006, forest reduced by about 50{\%} while built-up areas increased by about 300{\%}. A Participatory Learning Approach (PLA) involving experienced elderly local experts above 65 years old was conducted to assess their observations in the region on (i) LCC and (ii) the causes of water shortage, and (iii) the associated risk and adaptation/recommendation. The communities' local experts reported that changes in climatic condition, deforestation in the last 30 years and constructions of surface storages (reservoirs) are the major factors responsible for declining surface water in the region. There is thus, a good corroboration between the results of remotely sensed data of LCC assessment and the communities' local experts' observations of land cover changes and changes in surface water resources in the region. The study therefore inferred that LCC map products-information could be used in a participatory approach involving the communities to assess the impact of environmental change on an important service of forest ecosystems such as fresh water resources.},

abstract = {In this work we propose an approach for mapping flooded areas from Sentinel-2 MSI (Multispectral Instrument) data based on soft fuzzy integration of evidence scores derived from both band combinations (i.e. Spectral Indices - SIs) and components of the Hue, Saturation and Value (HSV) colour transformation. Evidence scores are integrated with Ordered Weighted Averaging (OWA) operators, which model user's decision attitude varying smoothly between optimistic and pessimistic approach. Output is a map of global evidence degree showing the plausibility of being flooded for each pixel of the input Sentinel-2 (S2) image. Algorithm set up and validation were carried out with data over three sites in Italy where water surfaces are extracted from stable water bodies (lakes and rivers), natural hazard flooding, and irrigated paddy rice fields. Validation showed more than satisfactory accuracy for the OR-like OWA operators (F-score {\textgreater} 0.90) with performance slightly decreased (F-score {\textless} 0.75) over heterogeneous conditions (e.g. rice fields). The algorithm was applied with no changes and/or tuning to independent sites from the Copernicus Emergency Management Service (EMS) activations to simulate operational conditions. Over these sites, the proposed approach achieved greater, more consistent and robust mapping accuracy compared to traditional approaches based on the segmentation of single input features. Moreover, OWA operators offer an appealing way of combining and aggregating multiple information in decision making by modelling uncertainty in decision process.

abstract = {In this study, spatiotemporal changes in Lake Burdur from 1987 to 2011 were evaluated using multi-temporal Landsat TM and ETM+ images. Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification and spectral water indexing, including the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), Modified NDWI (MNDWI) and Automated Water Extraction Index (AWEI), were used for extraction of surface water from image data. The spectral and spatial performance of each classifier was compared using Pearson's r, the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) and the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). The accuracies of the SVM and satellite-derived indexes were tested using the RMSE. Overall, SVM followed by the MNDWI, NDWI and AWEI yielded the best result among all the techniques in terms of their spectral and spatial quality. Spatiotemporal changes of the lake based on the applied method reveal an intense decreasing trend in surface area between 1987 and 2011, especially from 1987 to 2000, when the lake lost approximately one fifth of its surface area compared to that in 1987. The results show the effectiveness of SVM and MNDWI-based surface water change detection, particularly in identifying changes between specified time intervals.},

Haze degrades the quality of optical remote sensing data and reduces the accuracy of interpretation and classification. In this paper, we present an empirical single image-based haze removal method. Our work relies on an additive haze model, which describes at-satellite acquired radiance as the sum of globally constant path radiance, surface reflected radiance and spatially varying haze contribution. First, we search a tagged haze thickness map in band blue, green, red and near-infrared. Then a proportional strategy is adopted to infer haze thickness map of selected starting band from tagged haze thickness map and gain haze thickness map of other spectral bands from the starting band. Finally, haze is removed through subtracting haze thickness map from each band. The method is applicable for medium- and high- resolution satellite images and can handle scenes affected by different haze depths. Dehazed results are in good quality with improved visibility, enhanced image information and highly spectral consistency. The algorithm is simple enough and requires no human intervention, making it possible for use of non-experts and implementation of automatic batch processing.},

abstract = {Haze and cloud contamination is a common problem in optical remote-sensing imagery, as it can lead to the inaccurate estimation of physical properties of the surface derived from remote sensing and reduced accuracy of land cover classification and change detection. Haze optimized transform (HOT) is a methodology applicable to radiometric compensation of additive haze effects in visible bands that exhibits a spatially complex distribution over an image. The generic approach of HOT allows for the use of older satellite imaging sensors that include at least two visible bands (e.g. Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Landsat Multispectral Scanner (MSS) sensors). This study proposes modifications to extend HOT applicability to new sensors. The improvements and extended functionality adapt the method to the higher radiometric resolution specifications of newer generation sensors and use percentile-based minimum in the correction procedure to avoid causing fake minimum. Alternative filters are also evaluated to smooth raw HOT output and the cloud mask is generated as an additional output. A Landsat 8 scene of Los Angeles is used to demonstrate the improved methodology. The methodology is applicable to sensors such as QuickBird, Worldview 2/3. More than 20 additional scenes were used to evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology.},

By virtue of its hardware design, MSI's detectors exhibit a parallax angle that leads to subpixel shifts that are corrected with special preprocessing routines. However, these routines do not correct shifts for moving and/or high-altitude objects. In this letter, we apply a phase correlation approach to detect subpixel shifts between B2 (blue), B3 (green), and B4 (red) Sentinel-2A/MSI images. We show that shifts of more than 1.1 pixels can be observed for moving targets, such as airplanes and clouds, and can be used for cloud detection. We demonstrate that the proposed approach can detect clouds that are not identified in the built-in cloud mask provided within the Sentinel-2A Level-1C product.},

abstract = {Spatially varying haze is a common feature of most satellite images currently used for land cover classification and mapping and can significantly affect image quality. In this paper, we present a high-fidelity haze removal method based on Haze Optimized Transformation (HOT), comprising of three steps: semi-automatic HOT transform, HOT perfection and percentile based dark object subtraction (DOS). Since digital numbers (DNs) of band red and blue are highly correlated in clear sky, the R-squared criterion is utilized to search the relative clearest regions of the whole scene automatically. After HOT transform, spurious HOT responses are first masked out and filled by means of four-direction scan and dynamic interpolation, and then homomorphic filter is performed to compensate for loss of HOT of masked-out regions with large areas. To avoid patches and halo artifacts, a procedure called percentile DOS is implemented to eliminate the influence of haze. Scenes including various land cover types are selected to validate the proposed method, and a comparison analysis with HOT and Background Suppressed Haze Thickness Index (BSHTI) is performed. Three quality assessment indicators are selected to evaluate the haze removed effect on image quality from different perspective and band profiles are utilized to analyze the spectral consistency. Experiment results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method for haze removal and the superiority of it in preserving the natural color of object itself, enhancing local contrast, and maintaining structural information of original image.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 IEEE. Satellite Image Time Series (SITS) are sets of images acquired by the same or different spaceborne sensors over the same area at different acquisition times. In recent years, SITS acquired by multispectral sensors have increased, due to the large availability of these kind of data and the decrease in revisit time. The latter aspect is also a consequence of the advent of multispectral satellite constellations such as RapidEye and Pleiades, with the Sentinel 2 mission being able to derive such products at global scale in the near future. The high dimensionality of SITS unlocks the use of methods usually restricted to the processing of hyperspectral images, typically characterized by hundreds of narrow, contiguous spectral bands. This paper proposes a new cloud removal algorithm for scenes within a SITS based on the concept of spectral unmixing, which decomposes hyperspectral image elements into fractional abundances of reference spectra related to the materials present in a given scene. In the case of SITS, we consider a reference spectrum as a pixel which presents a characteristic evolution in time of its spectral features. While traditional methods aim at substituting the affected pixels with other ones taken from other scenes, the proposed algorithm allows exploiting the full spectral and temporal information of the SITS to synthesize the expected values below a cloudy area. This is done independently from the overall atmospheric interactions affecting a given image, and it is possible even if only one acquisition is available for a given period of time.},

abstract = {Satellite remote sensing image often suffers from haze degradation, which deteriorates significantly the effect of data intelligibility and interpretability. Hence, haze removal technique is essential for inferring high quality images with clear visibility to improve the application value of the satellite images. Thin haze removal is a challenging task since the estimation of haze component is easily affected by ground features. To solve the problem, this paper develops an effective haze removal method for a single visible remote sensing image. Firstly, haze is considered as an additive contamination and can be represented by a haze thickness map (HTM). A ground radiance suppressed HTM (GRS-HTM) is then proposed for a more precise estimation of haze distribution. The haze component for each band is calculated via GRS-HTM and can be removed to recover the clear image. Several visible satellite images with different resolutions were tested to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The evaluation results with qualitative and quantitative assessments demonstrate that the proposed method is superior to the traditional methods, and can recover a haze-free image with high quality.},

Then, the PCPs and the cloud probability mask are used together to derive the potential cloud layer. The darkening effect of the cloud shadows in the Near Infrared (NIR) Band is used to generate a potential shadow layer by applying the flood-fill transformation. Subsequently, 3D cloud objects are determined via segmentation of the potential cloud layer and assumption of a constant temperature lapse rate within each cloud object. The view angle of the satellite sensor and the illuminating angle are used to predict possible cloud shadow locations and select the one that has the maximum similarity with the potential cloud shadow mask. If the scene has snow, a snow mask is also produced. For a globally distributed set of reference data, the average Fmask overall cloud accuracy is as high as 96.4{\%}. The goal is development of a cloud and cloud shadow detection algorithm suitable for routine usage with Landsat images. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}In this paper we propose a cloud removal algorithm for scenes within a Sentinel-2 satellite image time series based on synthetisation of the affected areas via sparse reconstruction. For this purpose, a clouds and clouds shadow mask must be given. With respect to previous works, the process has an increased automation degree. Several dictionaries, on the basis of which the data are reconstructed, are selected randomly from cloud-free areas around the cloud, and for each pixel the dictionary yielding the smallest reconstruction error in non-corrupted images is chosen for the restoration. The values below a cloudy area are therefore estimated by observing the spectral evolution in time of the non-corrupted pixels around it. The proposed restoration algorithm is fast and efficient, requires minimal supervision and yield results with low overall radiometric and spectral distortions.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {The automated cloud cover assessment (ACCA) algorithm has provided automated estimates of cloud cover for the Landsat ETM+ mission since 2001. However, due to the lack of a band around 1.375$\mu$m, cloud edges and transparent clouds such as cirrus cannot be detected. Use of Landsat ETM+ imagery for terrestrial land analysis is further hampered by the relatively long revisit period due to a nadir only viewing sensor. In this study, the ACCA threshold parameters were altered to minimise omission errors in the cloud masks. Object-based analysis was used to reduce the commission errors from the extended cloud filters. The method resulted in the removal of optically thin cirrus cloud and cloud edges which are often missed by other methods in sub-tropical areas. Although not fully automated, the principles of the method developed here provide an opportunity for using otherwise sub-optimal or completely unusable Landsat ETM+ imagery for operational applications. Where specific images are required for particular research goals the method can be used to remove cloud and transparent cloud helping to reduce bias in subsequent land cover classifications. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Classification of clouds, cirrus, snow, shadows and clear sky areas is a crucial step in the pre-processing of optical remote sensing images and is a valuable input for their atmospheric correction. The Multi-Spectral Imager on board the Sentinel-2's of the Copernicus program offers optimized bands for this task and delivers unprecedented amounts of data regarding spatial sampling, global coverage, spectral coverage, and repetition rate. Efficient algorithms are needed to process, or possibly reprocess, those big amounts of data. Techniques based on top-of-atmosphere reflectance spectra for single-pixels without exploitation of external data or spatial context offer the largest potential for parallel data processing and highly optimized processing throughput. Such algorithms can be seen as a baseline for possible trade-offs in processing performance when the application of more sophisticated methods is discussed. We present several ready-to-use classification algorithms which are all based on a publicly available database of manually classified Sentinel-2A images. These algorithms are based on commonly used and newly developed machine learning techniques which drastically reduce the amount of time needed to update the algorithms when new images are added to the database. Several ready-to-use decision trees are presented which allow to correctly label about 91 {\%} of the spectra within a validation dataset. While decision trees are simple to implement and easy to understand, they offer only limited classification skill. It improves to 98 {\%} when the presented algorithm based on the classical Bayesian method is applied. This method has only recently been used for this task and shows excellent performance concerning classification skill and processing performance. A comparison of the presented algorithms with other commonly used techniques such as random forests, stochastic gradient descent, or support vector machines is also given. Especially random forests and support vector machines show similar classification skill as the classical Bayesian method.},

abstract = {For agronomic, environmental, and economic reasons, the need for spatialized information about agricultural practices is expected to rapidly increase. In this context, we reviewed the literature on remote sensing for mapping cropping practices. The reviewed studies were grouped into three categories of practices: crop succession (crop rotation and fallowing), cropping pattern (single tree crop planting pattern, sequential cropping, and intercropping/agroforestry), and cropping techniques (irrigation, soil tillage, harvest and post-harvest practices, crop varieties, and agro-ecological infrastructures). We observed that the majority of the studies were exploratory investigations, tested on a local scale with a high dependence on ground data, and used only one type of remote sensing sensor. Furthermore, to be correctly implemented, most of the methods relied heavily on local knowledge on the management practices, the environment, and the biological material. These limitations point to future research directions, such as the use of land stratification, multi-sensor data combination, and expert knowledge-driven methods. Finally, the new spatial technologies, and particularly the Sentinel constellation, are expected to improve the monitoring of cropping practices in the challenging context of food security and better management of agro-environmental issues.},

abstract = {This paper presents the SPOT-4 (Take 5) experiment, aimed at providing time series of optical images simulating the repetitivity, the resolution and the large swath of Sentinel-2 images. The aim was to help users set up and test their applications and methods, before Sentinel-2 mission data become available. In 2016, when both Sentinel-2 satellites are operational, and for at least fifteen years, users will have access to high resolution time series of images systematically acquired every five days, over the whole Earth land surfaces. Thanks to Sentinel-2's high revisit frequency, a given surface should be observed without clouds at least once a month, except in the most cloudy periods and regions. In 2013, the Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES) lowered the orbit altitude of SPOT-4, to place it on a five-day repeat cycle orbit for a duration of five months. This experiment started on 31 January 2013 and lasted until 19 June 2013. SPOT-4 images were acquired every fifth day, over 45 sites scattered in nearly all continents and covering very diverse biomes for various applications. Two ortho-rectified products were delivered for each acquired image that was not fully cloudy, expressed either as top of atmosphere reflectance (Level 1C) or as surface reflectance (Level 2A). An extensive validation campaign was held to check the performances of these products with regard to the multi-temporal registration, the quality of cloud masks, the accuracy of aerosol optical thickness estimates and the quality of surface reflectances. Despite high a priori geo-location errors, it was possible to register the images with an accuracy better than 0.5 pixels in the large majority of cases. Despite the lack of a blue band on the SPOT-4 satellite, the cloud and shadow detection yielded good results, while the aerosol optical thickness was measured with a root mean square error better than 0.06. The surface reflectances after atmospheric correction were compared with in situ data and other satellite data showing little bias and the standard deviation of surface reflectance errors in the range (0.01–0.02). The Take 5 experiment is being repeated in 2015 with the SPOT-5 satellite with an enhanced resolution.},

abstract = {In the frame of the Copernicus programme, ESA has developed and launched the Sentinel-2 optical imaging mission that delivers optical data products designed to feed downstream services mainly related to land monitoring, emergency management and security. The Sentinel-2 mission is the constellation of two polar orbiting satellites Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B, each one equipped with an optical imaging sensor MSI (Multi-Spectral Instrument). Sentinel-2A was launched on June 23 rd , 2015 and Sentinel-2B followed on March 7 th , 2017. With the beginning of the operational phase the constellation of both satellites enable image acquisition over the same area every 5 days or less. To use unique potential of the Sentinel-2 data for land applications and ensure the highest quality of scientific exploitation, accurate correction of satellite images for atmospheric effects is required. Therefore the atmospheric correction processor Sen2Cor was developed by Telespazio VEGA Deutschland GmbH on behalf of ESA. Sen2Cor is a Level-2A processor which main purpose is to correct single-date Sentinel-2 Level-1C Top-Of-Atmosphere (TOA) products from the effects of the atmosphere in order to deliver a Level-2A Bottom-Of-Atmosphere (BOA) reflectance product. Additional outputs are an Aerosol Optical Thickness (AOT) map, a Water Vapour (WV) map and a Scene Classification (SCL) map with Quality Indicators for cloud and snow probabilities. Telespazio France and DLR have teamed up in order to provide the calibration and validation of the Sen2Cor processor. Here we provide an overview over the Sentinel-2 data, processor and products. It presents some processing examples of Sen2Cor applied to Sentinel-2 data, provides up-to-date information about the Sen2Cor release status and recent validation results at the time of the SPIE Remote Sensing 2017.},

abstract = {Traditionally, researchers have employed statistical methods to model crime. However, these approaches are limited by being unable to model individual actions and behaviour. Brantingham and Brantingham (1993) described that in their opinion a useful and productive model for simulating crime would have the ability to model the occurrence of crime and the motivations behind it both temporally and spatially. This paper presents the construction and application of an agent-based model (ABM) for simulating occurrences of residential burglary at an individual level. It presents a novel framework that allows both human and environmental factors to be simulated. Although other agent-based models of crime do exist, this research represents the first working example of integrating a behavioural framework into an ABM for the simulation of crime. An artificial city, loosely based on the real city of Leeds, UK, and an artificial population were constructed, and experiments were run to explore the potential of the model to realistically simulate the main processes and drivers within this system. The results are highly promising, demonstrating the potential of this approach for both understanding processes behind crime and improving policies and developing effective crime prevention strategies. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Satellite data provide the only viable means for extensive monitoring of remote and large freshwater systems, such as the Amazon floodplain lakes. However, an accurate atmospheric correction is required to retrieve water constituents based on surface water reflectance (     R W     ). In this paper, we assessed three atmospheric correction methods (Second Simulation of a Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum (6SV), ACOLITE and Sen2Cor) applied to an image acquired by the MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) on-board of the European Space Agency's Sentinel-2A platform using concurrent in-situ measurements over four Amazon floodplain lakes in Brazil. In addition, we evaluated the correction of forest adjacency effects based on the linear spectral unmixing model, and performed a temporal evaluation of atmospheric constituents from Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) products. The validation of MAIAC aerosol optical depth (AOD) indicated satisfactory retrievals over the Amazon region, with a correlation coefficient (R) of {\~{}}0.7 and 0.85 for Terra and Aqua products, respectively. The seasonal distribution of the cloud cover and AOD revealed a contrast between the first and second half of the year in the study area. Furthermore, simulation of top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance showed a critical contribution of atmospheric effects ({\textgreater}50{\%}) to all spectral bands, especially the deep blue (92{\%}–96{\%}) and blue (84{\%}–92{\%}) bands. The atmospheric correction results of the visible bands illustrate the limitation of the methods over dark lakes (     R W      {\textless} 1{\%}), and better match of the      R W      shape compared with in-situ measurements over turbid lakes, although the accuracy varied depending on the spectral bands and methods. Particularly above 705 nm,      R W      was highly affected by Amazon forest adjacency, and the proposed adjacency effect correction minimized the spectral distortions in      R W      (RMSE {\textless} 0.006). Finally, an extensive validation of the methods is required for distinct inland water types and atmospheric conditions.},

abstract = {We present a technique to remove spatially varying haze contamination for high spatial resolution satellite imagery. This technique comprises three steps: haze detection, haze perfection and haze removal. Background Suppressed Haze Thickness Index (BSHTI) in haze detection is used to indicate relative haze thickness. ?Fill sink? and ?flatten peak? routines in haze perfection are applied to correct some spurious background effects. Virtual Cloud Point (VCP) method based on BSHTI is used in haze removal. Case study using two QuickBird images (hazy and clear) of Shenyang City in China proves the effectiveness of this technique except for those regions where haze is too thick. Comparison of the overlapped region between hazy and clear images using 76 paired polygon samples shows that squared correlation coefficient of each band between the two images becomes larger than 0.7. The advantages of this technique are that aerosol transparent bands are not needed and the technique is suitable for urban remote sensing.},

abstract = {Multispectral satellite images are often contaminated by haze and/or cirrus. A previous paper presented a haze removal method that calculates a haze thickness map (HTM) based on a local search of dark objects. The haze-free signal is restored by subtracting the HTM from the hazy image assuming an additive model of the haze influence. The HTM method is substantially improved by employing the 1.38-��m cirrus band. The top-of-atmosphere reflectance cirrus band is used as an additional source of information. The method restores the information in highly inhomogeneous surfaces attenuated by a low-altitude haze and high-altitude cirrus, improving the interpretation of the scene content while preserving the shape of the spectral signatures. The new enhanced HTM method is successfully applied to Landsat-8 OLI and Sentinel-2 real and simulated scenes.},

abstract = {Sentinel-2 is a very new programme of the European Space Agency (ESA) that is designed for fine spatial resolution global monitoring. Sentinel-2 images provide four 10 m bands and six 20 m bands. To provide more explicit spatial information, this paper aims to downscale the six 20 m bands to 10 m spatial resolution using the four directly observed 10 m bands. The outcome of this fusion task is the production of 10 Sentinel-2 bands with 10 m spatial resolution. This new fusion problem involves four fine spatial resolution bands, which is different to, and more complex than, the common pan-sharpening fusion problem which involves only one fine band. To address this, we extend the existing two main families of image fusion approaches (i.e., component substitution, CS, and multiresolution analysis, MRA) with two different schemes, a band synthesis scheme and a band selection scheme. Moreover, the recently developed area-to-point regression kriging (ATPRK) approach was also developed and applied for the Sentinel-2 fusion task. Using two Sentinel-2 datasets released online, the three types of approaches (eight CS and MRA-based approaches, and ATPRK) were compared comprehensively in terms of their accuracies to provide recommendations for the task of fusion of Sentinel-2 images. The downscaled ten-band 10 m Sentinel-2 datasets represent important and promising products for a wide range of applications in remote sensing. They also have potential for blending with the upcoming Sentinel-3 data for fine spatio-temporal resolution monitoring at the global scale.},

abstract = {The Sentinel-2A multi-spectral instrument (MSI) acquires multi-spectral reflective wavelength observations with directional effects due to surface reflectance anisotropy and changes in the solar and viewing geometry. Directional effects were examined by considering two ten day periods of Sentinel-2A data acquired close to the solar principal and orthogonal planes over approximately 20° × 10° of southern Africa. More than 6.6 million (January 2016) and 10.6 million (April 2016) pairs of reflectance observations sensed 3 or 7 days apart in the forward and backscatter directions in overlapping Sentinel-2A orbit swaths were considered. The Sentinel-2A data were projected into the MODIS sinusoidal projection but first had to be registered due to a misregistration issue evident in the overlapping orbits. The top of atmosphere reflectance data were corrected to surface reflectance using the SEN2COR atmospheric correction software. Only pairs of forward and backward reflectance values that were cloud and snow-free, unsaturated, and had no significant change in their 3 or 7 day separation, were considered. The maximum observed Sentinel-2A view zenith angle was 11.93°. Greater BRDF effects were apparent in the January data (acquired close to the solar principal plane) than the April data (acquired close to the orthogonal plane) and at higher view zenith angle. For the January data the average difference between the surface reflectance in the forward and backward scatter directions at the Sentinel-2A scan edges increased with wavelength from 0.035 (blue), 0.047 (green), 0.057 (red), 0.078 (NIR), to about 0.1 (SWIR). These differences may constitute a significant source of noise for certain applications. The suitability of a recently published methodology developed to generate Landsat nadir BRDF-adjusted reflectance (NBAR) was examined for Sentinel-2A application. The methodology uses fixed MODIS BRDF spectral parameters and is attractive because it has little sensitivity to the land cover type, condition, or surface disturbance and can be derived in a computationally efficient manner globally. It was applied to the southern Africa Sentinel-2A data and shown to reduce Sentinel-2A BRDF effects. The average difference between the reflectance in the forward and backward scatter directions at the Sentinel-2A scan edges was smaller in the NBAR data than in the corresponding surface reflectance data. Residual BRDF effects in the Sentinel-2A NBAR data occurred likely because of atmospheric correction and sensor calibration errors and inadequacies in the NBAR derivation approach. These issues are discussed with recommendations for future research including global and red-edge Sentinel-2A NBAR derivation that were not considered in this study.},

The recently launched Landsat-8 provides coastal/aerosol and cirrus bands to tackle this problem. In this case, clouds can be accurately detected with Landsat-8 data, and the masked cloud areas could be filled in with image processing methods. This paper presents a novel method for detection and filling of cloud and its shadow areas using the Landsat-8 sensor. First, cloud and its shadow areas are detected from the Landsat-8 bands using Otsu's thresholding method. The detected cloud and cloud-shadow areas are then replaced using coordinates of a reference image and pixel values from an experimental image corresponding to the coordinates of reference image. Experimental results using the Landsat-8 dataset indicated that the proposed method generates a superior quality of cloud free imagery.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 1980-2012 IEEE. Cloud removal is an important goal for enhancing the utilization of optical remote sensing satellite images. Clouds dynamically affect the signal transmission due to their different shapes, heights, and distribution. In the case of thick opaque clouds, pixel replacement has been commonly adopted. For thin clouds, pixel correction techniques allow the effects of thin clouds to be removed while retaining the remaining information in the contaminated pixels. In this paper, we develop a new method based on signal transmission and spectral mixture analysis for pixel correction which makes use of a cloud removal model that considers not only the additive reflectance from the clouds but also the energy absorption when solar radiation passes through them. Data correction is achieved by subtracting the product of the cloud endmember signature and the cloud abundance and rescaling according to the cloud thickness. The proposed method has no requirement for meteorological data and does not rely on reference images. Our experimental results indicate that the proposed approach is able to perform effective removal of thin clouds in different scenarios.},

abstract = {The quantitative use of space-based optical imagery requires atmospheric correction to separate the contributions from the surface and the atmosphere. The MACCS (Multi-sensor Atmospheric Correction and Cloud Screening)-ATCOR (Atmospheric and Topographic Correction) Joint Algorithm, called MAJA, is a numerical tool designed to perform cloud detection and atmospheric correction. For the correction of aerosols effects, MAJA makes an estimate of the aerosol optical thickness (AOT) based on multi-temporal and multi-spectral criteria, but there is insufficient information to infer the aerosol type. The current operational version of MAJA uses an aerosol type which is constant with time, and this assumption impacts the quality of the atmospheric correction. In this study, we assess the potential of using an aerosol type derived from the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) operational analysis. The performances, with and without the CAMS information, are evaluated. Firstly, in terms of the aerosol optical thickness retrievals, a comparison against sunphotometer measurements over several sites indicates an improvement over arid sites, with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) reduced by 28{\%} (from 0.095 to 0.068), although there is a slight degradation over vegetated sites (RMSE increased by 13{\%}, from 0.054 to 0.061). Secondly, a direct validation of the retrieved surface reflectances at the La Crau station (France) indicates a reduction of the relative bias by 2.5{\%} on average over the spectral bands. Thirdly, based on the assumption that surface reflectances vary slowly with time, a noise criterion was set up, exhibiting no improvement over the spectral bands and the validation sites when using CAMS data, partly explained by a slight increase in the surface reflectances themselves. Finally, the new method presented in this study provides a better way of using the MAJA processor in an operational environment because the aerosol type used for the correction is automatically inferred from CAMS data, and is no longer a parameter to be defined in advance.},

Multi-spectral channels of LANDSAT-8 satellite image collected for two different dates of acquisition are used in the current study. Reflectance values of cirrus band are used for correcting red and near infra-red spectral channels based on standard cirrus correction algorithm. The NDVI values obtained after cirrus correction is found to be significantly more than that of NDVI values without cirrus correction. In the case of AFRI(2.1m), the difference in values between before and after cirrus correction is found to be considerably lower than that of NDVI variation. These outcomes show the suitability of AFRI(2.1m) over NDVI for cirrus affected satellite images. The results of analysis also reveal that NDVI difference is directly proportionate with optical thickness and ice particle size distribution of cirrus clouds.},

abstract = {To realize highly precise and automatic cloud detection from multi-sensors, this paper proposes a cloud detection algorithm-generating (CDAG) method for remote sensing data from visible to short-wave infrared (SWIR) bands. Hyperspectral remote sensing data with high spatial resolution were collected and used as a pixel dataset of cloudy and clear skies. In this paper, multi-temporal AVIRIS (Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer) data with 224 bands at visible to SWIR wavelengths and a 20 m spatial resolution were used for the dataset. Based on the pixel dataset, pixels of different types of clouds and land cover were distinguished artificially and used for the simulation of multispectral sensors. Cloud detection algorithms for the multispectral remote sensing sensors were then generated based on the spectral differences between the cloudy and clear-sky pixels distinguished previously. The possibility of assigning a pixel as cloudy was calculated based on the reliability of each method. Landsat 8 OLI (Operational Land Imager), MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) Terra and Suomi NPP VIIRS (Visible/Infrared Imaging Radiometer) were used for the cloud detection test with the CDAG method, and the results from each sensor were compared with the corresponding artificial results, demonstrating an accurate detection rate of more than 85{\%}.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016, Saudi Society for Geosciences. The presence of clouds can restrict the potential uses of remote sensing satellite imagery in extracting information and interpretation. Automatic detection and removal of clouds which hide significant information in the image is an important task in remote sensing. Hence, our aim is to detect clouds and restore the missing information in order to make the image ready for further analysis and applications. Due to the difference in nature and appearance, thick and thin clouds are dealt separately. Thick cloud is detected using an efficient Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering algorithm, while thin cloud is detected using a simple region growing technique. In order to reconstruct the missing pixels, we utilize the prior knowledge about the statistics of the specific image class. Kernel principal component analysis (KPCA)-based image model is obtained using a set of training images. Missing area in the image is restored after an iterative projection operation and gradient descent algorithm. In short, an image lying out of the modelled image space is iteratively modified to obtain the restored image and that would be in the image space according to the obtained nonlinear low-dimensional and sparse KPCA image model. To illustrate the performance of the proposed method, a thorough experimental analysis on FORMOSAT multi-spectral images is done using MATLAB platform. When compared to the two recent existing techniques, our proposed method is superior and makes a promising tool for thick and thin cloud removal in multi-spectral satellite images.},

abstract = {Contrast enhancement of hazy image, or known as image dehazing has always been a practical and challenging topic in image processing and analysis field. Quite a number of strategies have been proposed to determine the depth information, which reflects the thickness of haze over the captured natural images. However, as for remote sensing imagery, too high satellite orbit makes the depth information meaningless. Most of the existing physical-model based methods of natural images fail to enhance the contrast of satellite imagery. In this paper, we present a simple but effective method to remove the haze from single satellite image. This method is developed with the linear intensity transformation (LIT) and local property analysis (LPA). Considering the difference between impacts of depth information on hazy natural image and hazy satellite image, we firstly employ classical degradation model to demonstrate the rationality of utilizing LIT to enhance the visibility of hazy satellite imagery. And then, we propose to adaptively estimate parameters of LIT by analyzing the local image properties of luminance, chromatics and texture. Experimental results on hazy satellite imagery, obtained from Google Earth and NASA Earth Observatory websites, illustrate that compared with state-of-the-arts, the proposed method can more efficiently and effectively on enhancing the overall contrast of hazy satellite imagery.},

abstract = {In land monitoring applications, clouds and shadows are considered noise that should be removed as automatically and quickly as possible, before further analysis. This paper presents a method to detect clouds and shadows in Suomi NPP satellite's VIIRS (Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite) satellite images. The proposed cloud and shadow detection method has two distinct features when compared to many other methods. First, the method does not use the thermal bands and can thus be applied to other sensors which do not contain thermal channels, such as Sentinel-2 data. Secondly, the method uses the ratio between blue and green reflectance to detect shadows. Seven hundred and forty-seven VIIRS images over Fennoscandia from August 2014 to April 2016 were processed to train and develop the method. Twenty four points from every tenth of the images were used in accuracy assessment. These 1752 points were interpreted visually to cloud, cloud shadow and clear classes, then compared to the output of the cloud and shadow detection. The comparison on VIIRS images showed 94.2{\%} correct detection rates and 11.1{\%} false alarms for clouds, and respectively 36.1{\%} and 82.7{\%} for shadows. The results on cloud detection were similar to state-of-the-art methods. Shadows showed correctly on the northern edge of the clouds, but many shadows were wrongly assigned to other classes in some cases (e.g., to water class on lake and forest boundary, or with shadows over cloud). This may be due to the low spatial resolution of VIIRS images, where shadows are only a few pixels wide and contain lots of mixed pixels.},

abstract = {Cloud removal is a prerequisite for the application of Landsat datasets, as such satellite images are invariably contaminated by clouds. Clouds affect the transmission of radiation signal to different degrees because of their different thicknesses, shapes, heights and distributions. Existing methods utilize pixel replacement to remove thick clouds and pixel correction techniques to rectify thin clouds in order to retain the land surface information in contaminated pixels. However, a major limitation of these methods refers to their deficiency in retrieving land surface reflectance when both thick clouds and thin clouds exist in the images, as the two types of clouds differ in the transmission of radiation signal. As most remotely sensed images show rather complex cloud contamination patterns, an efficient method to alleviate both thin and thick cloud effects is in need of development. To this end, the paper proposes a new method to rectify cloud contamination based on the cloud detection of iterative haze-optimized transformation (IHOT) and the cloud removal of cloud trajectory (IHOT-Trajectory). The cloud trajectory is able to take consideration of signal transmission for different levels of cloud contamination, which characterizes the spectral response of a certain type of land cover under increasing cloud thickness. Specifically, this method consists in four steps. First, the cloud thicknesses of contaminated pixels are estimated by the IHOT. Second, areas affected by cloud shadows are marked. Third, cloud trajectories are fitted with the aid of neighboring similar pixels under different cloud thickness. Last, contaminated areas are rectified according to the relationship between the land surface reflectance and the IHOT. The experimental results indicate that the proposed approach is able to effectively remove both the thin and thick clouds and erase the cloud shadows of Landsat images under different scenarios. In addition, the proposed method was compared with the dark object subtraction (DOS), the modified neighborhood similar pixel interpolator (MNSPI) and the multitemporal dictionary learning (MDL) methods. Quantitative assessments show that the IHOT-Trajectory method is superior to the other cloud removal methods overall. For specific spectral bands, the proposed method performs better than other methods in visible bands, whereas it does not necessarily perform better in infrared bands.},

abstract = {We developed a new algorithm called Tmask (multiTemporal mask) for automated masking of cloud, cloud shadow, and snow for multitemporal Landsat images. This algorithm consists of two steps. The first step is based on a single-date algorithm called Fmask (Function of mask) that initially screens most of the clouds, cloud shadows, and snow. The second step benefits from the extra temporal information from the remaining "clear" pixels and further improves the cloud, cloud shadow, and snow mask. Three Top Of Atmosphere (TOA) reflectance bands (Bands 2, 4, and 5 - Landsat-7 band numbering) are used in a Robust Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares (RIRLS) method to estimate a time series model for each pixel. By comparing model estimates with Landsat observations for the three spectral bands, the Tmask algorithm is capable of detecting any remaining clouds, cloud shadows, and snow for an entire stack of Landsat images. Generally, this algorithm will not falsely identify land cover changes as clouds, cloud shadows, or snow, as it is capable of modeling land cover change. The multitemporal images also provide extra information for better discrimination of cloud and snow, which is difficult for single-date algorithm. A snow threshold is derived for Band 5 TOA reflectance for each pixel at each specific time based on a modified Norwegian Linear Reflectance-to-Snow-Cover (NLR) algorithm. By comparing the results of Tmask with a single-date algorithm (Fmask) for multitemporal Landsat images located at Path 12 Row 31, significant improvements are observed for identification of clouds, cloud shadows, and snow. The most significant improvement is observed for cloud shadow detection. Many of the errors in cloud, cloud shadow, and snow detection observed in Fmask are corrected by the Tmask algorithm. The goal is development of a cloud, cloud shadow, and snow detection algorithm that results in a multitemporal stack of images that is free of "noise" factors and thus suitable for detection of land cover change. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

In this paper, the haze optimized transform (HOT) approach for visible-band correction is described, and its impact on classification performance is evaluated. Assessment is conducted at three levels: radiometric level of accuracy, improve- ment in interclass separability, and classification accuracy. Results obtained from hazy scenes and their dehazed counterparts are compared with those from reference or “benchmark” clear scenes. Radiometric analyses of pseudoinvariant features (dense forest stands) indicate that effective haze reduction can be realized for differential HOT response levels of up to 20 for Landsat Thematic Mapper scenes. This level of atmospheric contamination is severe enough to result in significant thematic class confusion, wherein visible-band radiances of vegetated areas are at levels normally associated with urban features under clear sky conditions.},

Scatterplots were generated and linear regression performed for the reflectance values of each band before and after the algorithm, and compared to those of the reference image. Band-by-band, results in cloud removal were acceptable. The algorithm had little effect on pixels in cloud-free areas after the analyses of histograms, scatterplots, and linear regression equations.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Multiple reconstructive procedures are common for the reconstruction of complex facial deformities of skin, soft tissues, bony structures, and functional subunits, such as the nose, lips, and eyelids. However, the results have been unsatisfactory. An innovative approach entailing a single surgical procedure of face allograft transplantation is a viable alternative and gives improved results. METHODS: On Dec 9, 2008, a 45-year-old woman with a history of severe midface trauma underwent near-total face transplantation in which 80{\%} of her face was replaced with a tailored composite tissue allograft. We addressed issues of immunosuppressive therapy, psychological and ethical outcomes, and re-integration of the patient into society. FINDINGS: After the operation, the patient did well physically and psychologically, and tolerated immunosuppression without any major complication. Routine biopsy on day 47 after transplantation showed rejection of graft mucosa; however, a single bolus of corticosteroids reversed rejection. During the first 3 weeks after transplantation, the patient accepted her new face; 6 months after surgery, the functional outcome has been excellent. In contrast to her status before transplantation, the patient can now breathe through her nose, smell, taste, speak intelligibly, eat solid foods, and drink from a cup. INTERPRETATION: We show the feasibility of reconstruction of severely disfigured patients in a single surgical procedure using composite face allotransplantation. Therefore, this should be taken in consideration as an early option for severely disfigured patients. FUNDING: None.},

Poor reporting of systematic reviews diminishes their value to clinicians, policy makers, and other users.Since the development of the QUOROM (QUality Of Reporting Of Meta-analysis) Statement--a reporting guideline published in 1999--there have been several conceptual, methodological, and practical advances regarding the conduct and reporting of systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Also, reviews of published systematic reviews have found that key information about these studies is often poorly reported. Realizing these issues, an international group that included experienced authors and methodologists developed PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) as an evolution of the original QUOROM guideline for systematic reviews and meta-analyses of evaluations of health care interventions.The PRISMA Statement consists of a 27-item checklist and a four-phase flow diagram. The checklist includes items deemed essential for transparent reporting of a systematic review. In this Explanation and Elaboration document, we explain the meaning and rationale for each checklist item. For each item, we include an example of good reporting and, where possible, references to relevant empirical studies and methodological literature.

abstract = {Cirrus is one of the most common artifacts in the remotely sensed optical data. Contrary to the low altitude (1-3 km) cloud the cirrus cloud (8-20 km) is semitransparent and the extinction (cirrus influence) of the upward reflected solar radiance can be compensated. The widely employed and almost 'de-facto' method for cirrus compensation is based on the 1.38$\mu$m spectral channel measuring the upwelling radiance reflected by the cirrus cloud. The knowledge on the cirrus spatial distribution allows to estimate the per spectral channel cirrus attenuation and to compensate the spectral channels. A wide range of existing and expected sensors have no 1.38$\mu$m spectral channel. These sensors data can be corrected by the recently developed haze/cirrus removal method. The additive model of the estimated cirrus thickness map (CTM) is applicable for cirrus-conditioned extinction compensation. Numeric and statistic evaluation of the CTM-based cirrus removal on more than 80 Landsat-8 OLI and 30 Sentinel-2 scenes demonstrates a close agreement with the 1.38$\mu$m channel based cirrus removal.},

abstract = {Over lands, the cloud detection on remote sensing images is not an easy task, because of the frequent difficulty to distinguish clouds from the underlying landscape, even at a high resolution. Up to now, most high resolution images have been distributed without an associated cloud mask. This situation should change in the near future, thanks to two new satellite missions that will provide optical images combining 3 features: high spatial resolution, high revisit frequency and constant viewing angles. The VEN$\mu$S (French and Israeli cooperation) mission should be launched in 2012 and the European SENTINEL-2 mission in 2013. Fortunately, two existing satellite missions, FORMOSAT-2 and LANDSAT, enable to simulate the future data of these sensors.Multi-temporal imagery at constant viewing angles provides a new way to discriminate clouded and unclouded pixels, using the relative stability of the earth surface reflectances compared to the quick variations of the reflectance of pixels affected by clouds. In this study, we have used time series of images from FORMOSAT-2 and LANDSAT to develop and test a Multi-Temporal Cloud Detection (MTCD) method. This algorithm combines a detection of a sudden increase of reflectance in the blue wavelength on a pixel by pixel basis, and a test of the linear correlation of pixel neighborhoods taken from couples of images acquired successively.MTCD cloud masks are compared with cloud cover assessments obtained from FORMOSAT-2 and LANDSAT data catalogs. The results show that the MTCD method provides a better discrimination of clouded and unclouded pixels than the usual methods based on thresholds applied to reflectances or reflectance ratios. This method will be used within VEN$\mu$S level 2 processing and will be proposed for SENTINEL-2 level 2 processing. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {This paper reviews some programming techniques in R that have proved useful, particularly for substantial projects. These include several versions of object-oriented programming, used in a large number of R packages. The review tries to clarify the origins and ideas behind the various versions, each of which is valuable in the appropriate context. R has also been strongly influenced by the ideas of functional programming and, in particular, by the desire to combine functional with object oriented programming. To clarify how this particular mix of ideas has turned out in the current R language and supporting software, the paper will first review the basic ideas behind object-oriented and functional programming, and then examine the evolution of R with these ideas providing context. Functional programming supports well-defined, defensible software giving reproducible results. Object-oriented programming is the mechanism par excellence for managing complexity while keeping things simple for the user. The two paradigms have been valuable in supporting major software for fitting models to data and numerous other statistical applications. The paradigms have been adopted, and adapted, distinctively in R. Functional programming motivates much of R but R does not enforce the paradigm. Object-oriented programming from a functional perspective differs from that used in non-functional languages, a distinction that needs to be emphasized to avoid confusion. R initially replicated the S language from Bell Labs, which in turn was strongly influenced by earlier program libraries. At each stage, new ideas have been added, but the previous software continues to show its influence in the design as well. Outlining the evolution will further clarify why we currently have this somewhat unusual combination of ideas.},

abstract = {Ever-present spatially varying haze contamination in satellite scenes limits appli-cations using visible and near-infrared bands of low-temporal-resolution multi-spectral satellite images. A relative atmospheric correction technique, the virtual cloud point (VCP) method, which is based on advanced haze-optimized transfor-mation (AHOT), is developed for haze removal. It is an improved algorithm of the previous dark-object subtraction (DOS) based on haze-optimized transformation (HOT). In AHOT, extra steps are added to HOT to remove confusion caused by some land-cover types. The VCP method uses the upper bound of the histogram, as well as the lower bound, so that it enlarges the digital number (DN) variance reduced by haze, which is not considered in DOS. To evaluate this algorithm, hazy subsets of one Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and one QuickBird image are employed. Through before-and-after comparison using true-colour images and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), it proves that the VCP method based on AHOT is apparently better than DOS based on HOT, when haze is distributed over urban areas where vegetation is sparse.},

abstract = {Clouds are a pervasive and unavoidable issue in satellite-borne optical imagery. Accurate, well-documented, and automated cloud detection algorithms are necessary to effectively leverage large collections of remotely sensed data. The Landsat project is uniquely suited for comparative validation of cloud assessment algorithms because the modular architecture of the Landsat ground system allows for quick evaluation of new code, and because Landsat has the most comprehensive manual truth masks of any current satellite data archive. Currently, the Landsat Level-1 Product Generation System (LPGS) uses separate algorithms for determining clouds, cirrus clouds, and snow and/or ice probability on a per-pixel basis. With more bands onboard the Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI)/Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) satellite, and a greater number of cloud masking algorithms, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) is replacing the current cloud masking workflow with a more robust algorithm that is capable of working across multiple Landsat sensors with minimal modification. Because of the inherent error from stray light and intermittent data availability of TIRS, these algorithms need to operate both with and without thermal data. In this study, we created a workflow to evaluate cloud and cloud shadow masking algorithms using cloud validation masks manually derived from both Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM +) and Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS data. We created a new validation dataset consisting of 96 Landsat 8 scenes, representing different biomes and proportions of cloud cover. We evaluated algorithm performance by overall accuracy, omission error, and commission error for both cloud and cloud shadow. We found that CFMask, C code based on the Function of Mask (Fmask) algorithm, and its confidence bands have the best overall accuracy among the many algorithms tested using our validation data. The Artificial Thermal-Automated Cloud Cover Algorithm (AT-ACCA) is the most accurate nonthermal-based algorithm. We give preference to CFMask for operational cloud and cloud shadow detection, as it is derived from a priori knowledge of physical phenomena and is operable without geographic restriction, making it useful for current and future land imaging missions without having to be retrained in a machine-learning environment.},

In the frame of this programme, ESA is developing the Sentinel-2 optical imaging mission that will deliver optical data products designed to feed downstream services mainly related to land monitoring, emergency management and security. To ensure the highest quality of service, ESA sets up the Sentinel-2 Mission Performance Centre (MPC) in charge of the overall performance monitoring of the Sentinel-2 mission. TPZ F and DLR have teamed up in order to provide the best added-value support to the MPC for calibration and validation of the Level-2A processor (Sen2Cor) and products. This paper gives an overview over the planned L2A calibration and validation activities. Level-2A processing is applied to Top-Of-Atmosphere (TOA) Level-1C ortho-image reflectance products. Level-2A main output is the Bottom-Of-Atmosphere (BOA) corrected reflectance product. Additional outputs are an Aerosol Optical Thickness (AOT) map, a Water Vapour (WV) map and a Scene Classification (SC) map with Quality Indicators for cloud and snow probabilities. Level-2A BOA, AOT and WV outputs are calibrated and validated using ground-based data of automatic operating stations and data of in-situ campaigns. Scene classification is validated by the visual inspection of test datasets and cross-sensor comparison, supplemented by meteorological data, if available. Contributions of external in-situ campaigns would enlarge the reference dataset and enable extended validation exercise. Therefore, we are highly interested in and welcome external contributors.},

abstract = {Identification of clouds, cloud shadows and snow in optical images is often a necessary step toward their use. Recently a new program (named Fmask) designed to accomplish these tasks was introduced for use with images from Landsats 4-7 (Zhu {\&} Woodcock, 2012). In this paper, there are the following: (1) improvements in the Fmask algorithm for Landsats 4-7; (2) a new version for use with Landsat 8 that takes advantage of the new cirrus band; and (3) a prototype algorithm for Sentinel 2 images. Though Sentinel 2 images do not have a thermal band to help with cloud detection, the new cirrus band is found to be useful for detecting clouds, especially for thin cirrus clouds. By adding a new cirrus cloud probability and removing the steps that use the thermal band, the Sentinel 2 scenario achieves significantly better results than the Landsats 4-7 scenario for all 7 images tested. For Landsat 8, almost all the Fmask algorithm components are the same as for Landsats 4-7, except a new cirrus cloud probability is calculated using the new cirrus band, which improves detection of thin cirrus clouds. Landsat 8 results are better than the Sentinel 2 scenario, with 6 out of 7 test images showing higher accuracies.},

abstract = {Monitoring small water bodies ({\textless}50 ha) is difficult due to their size, limiting accurate assessments of surface water (SW) resources required for agricultural production and watershed hydrology. In environments where livelihoods depend on surface-water storage (SWS) structures, satellite altimetry-derived water levels are often unavailable. Therefore, seasonal reservoirs require a robust and cost-effective approach for estimating SWS. To approximate SWS throughout a typical environmental setting where irrigation reservoirs are found, we investigate the utility of TanDEM-X digital elevation model (DEM) to extract bathymetry of seasonal reservoir structures. Empirically-derived SWS relationships are combined with estimates of SW area from radar and multi-source optical satellites to illustrate the potential for rapid SWS estimation using satellite-based SW extent as input. Two application examples illustrate the approach: (i) estimating the maximum volume of water in a southern Indian river basin for two monsoon seasons; and (ii) a time-series analysis using a high-volume of satellite observations to show the cycle of water (inflow and outflow) at the reservoir scale. SWS volumes at water levels below 1.5 m were estimated within an absolute volume error range of 6–8{\%}. This study illustrates the applicability and challenges of using satellite remote sensing observations to continuously monitor reservoir SWS. Despite the cloud independent capability for operational monitoring of SW area, Sentinel-1 data should be combined with frequent and high spatial resolution CubeSat observations for hydrometric monitoring of reservoirs to reduce observation errors. Furthermore, we highlight the multi-sensor approach (optical and radar) to achieve high spatio-temporal resolution monitoring of small reservoirs over large spatial scales.},

abstract = {Satellite derived bathymetry (SDB) enables rapid mapping of large coastal areas through measurement of optical penetration of the water column. The resolution of bathymetric mapping and achievable horizontal and vertical accuracies vary but generally, all SDB outputs are constrained by sensor type, water quality and other environmental conditions. Efforts to improve accuracy include physics-based methods (similar to radiative transfer models e.g. for atmospheric/vegetation studies) or detailed in-situ sampling of the seabed and water column, but the spatial component of SDB measurements is often under-utilised in SDB workflows despite promising results suggesting potential to improve accuracy significantly. In this study, a selection of satellite datasets (Landsat 8, RapidEye and Pleiades) at different spatial and spectral resolutions were tested using a log ratio transform to derive bathymetry in an Atlantic coastal embayment. A series of non-spatial and spatial linear analyses were then conducted and their influence on SDB prediction accuracy was assessed in addition to the significance of each model's parameters. Landsat 8 (30 m pixel size) performed relatively weak with the non-spatial model, but showed the best results with the spatial model. However, the highest spatial resolution imagery used – Pleiades (2 m pixel size) showed good results across both non-spatial and spatial models which suggests a suitability for SDB prediction at a higher spatial resolution than the others. In all cases, the spatial models were able to constrain the prediction differences at increased water depths.},

abstract = {Understanding long-term sandbar dynamics can be crucial for informed coastal zone management, but is often hampered by data availability. To increase the number of sandbar observations available from bathymetric surveys, this study proposes and evaluates a method to manually extract the sandbar location using freely available satellite imagery for the case study of Anmok beach in South Korea. Validation of the satellite extracted sandbar locations against 9 in-situ measurements shows good agreement with errors well within the pixel resolution of the satellite imagery (i.e. 30 m for Landsat missions). The applicability of the method is constrained to locations where (1) the cross-shore crescentic length scales are larger than the image resolution, (2) frequent wave breaking and clouds are absent and (3) the water clarity is sufficient to enable the manual extraction of the sandbar crest line. Using the additional sandbar observations from the satellite imagery significantly increases the temporal extent and resolution of the dataset for Anmok beach. This allows the study of sandbar characteristics, dynamics and impacts of human interventions to an extent that would not have been possible without the satellite imagery. Within the study period 1990–2017 it is found that the sandbar maintains a persistent crescentic pattern that is only altered during prolonged and very intense storm conditions. The cumulative alongshore migration of the sandbars is investigated and found to be in the order of hundreds of meters over the 27 years study period. Comparing the sandbar characteristics prior and after the construction of Gangneung port shows that both the amplitudes and wavelengths of the sandbar crescents near the port have decreased after its construction.},

We provide the first comprehensive evaluation for Landsat-8 Rrs retrievals in optically shallow coral reefs, along with an investigation of Landsat-8 Rrs products in a temperate turbid embayment. The obtained Landsat-8 Rrs data products are evaluated with concurrent in situ hyperspectral Rrs measurements. Our analyses show that the NASA and the cloud-shadow approaches generated reliable Rrs products across shallow coral reefs and optically deep waters. This evaluation suggests that high quality Rrs products are achievable from the Landsat-8 satellite in optically shallow environments, which supports further application of Landsat-8 type measurements for coral reef studies.},

abstract = {The intertidal zone represents a critical transition between marine and terrestrial ecosystems, supporting a complex mosaic of highly productive and biologically diverse habitats. However, our understanding of these important coastal environments is limited by a lack of spatially consistent topographic data, which can be extremely challenging and costly to obtain at continental-scale. Satellite remote sensing represents an important resource for monitoring extensive coastal zones. Previous approaches to modelling the elevation of the intertidal zone using earth observation (EO) data have been restricted to small study regions or have relied on manual image interpretation, thus limiting their ability to be applied consistently over large geographic extents. In this study, we present an automated open-source approach to generate satellite-derived elevation data for over 15,387 km2 of intertidal terrain across the entire Australian coastline. Our approach combines global tidal modelling with a 30-year time series archive of spatially and spectrally calibrated Landsat satellite data managed within the Digital Earth Australia (DEA) platform. The resulting National Intertidal Digital Elevation Model (NIDEM) dataset provides an unprecedented three-dimensional representation of Australia's vast exposed intertidal zone at 25 m spatial resolution. We validate our model against LiDAR, RTK GPS and multibeam bathymetry datasets, finding that modelled elevations are highly accurate across sandy beach (±0.41 m RMSE) and tidal flat environments (±0.39 m RMSE). Model performance was least accurate (±2.98 m RMSE) within rocky shores and reefs and other complex coastal environments with extreme and variable tidal regimes. We discuss key challenges associated with modelling intertidal elevation including tidal model performance and biased observations from sun-synchronous satellites, and suggest future directions to improve the accuracy and utility of continental-scale intertidal elevation modelling. Our model can be applied to tidally-influenced coastal environments globally, addressing a key gap between the availability of sub-tidal bathymetry and terrestrial elevation data.},

abstract = {The Sentinel-2A and 2B Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) offers a specification of potential value toward a number of objectives in remote sensing of coral reefs. Coral reefs represent a unique challenge for remote sensing, being highly heterogeneous at metre scales and occurring at variable depths and water clarity regimes. However, conservation initiatives, such as the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, add urgency to the need for the large scale environmental monitoring information that remote sensing can provide. In the quest to meet this challenge a range of satellite instruments have been leveraged, from Landsat to high spatial resolution sensors such as WorldView-2, toward objectives such as: mapping of bottom types, bathymetry, change detection, and detection of coral bleaching events. Sentinel-2A and 2B offer a new paradigm of available instruments, with a 5-day revisit, 10 m multispectral spatial resolution and freely available data. Pre-launch simulation analyses by several of the authors suggested Sentinel-2 would have good performance for reef applications, in this paper we follow up on this study by reviewing the potential based on the substantial archive of actual data now available. First we determine to what extent the World's reefs are covered by Sentinel-2, since the mission requirements do not by default include all reefs. Secondly we review how a 5-day revisit translates to a usable acquisition rate of clear images, given that cloud and surface glint are common confounding factors. The usable acquisition rate is the real determinant of the objectives to which the data can be applied. Finally we apply current processing algorithms to Sentinel-2 data of several sites over the Great Barrier Reef, including physics-based bathymetry inversion and object-orientated benthic mapping. Landsat 8 OLI is most comparable current sensor to Sentinel-2 MSI, so direct comparisons and the possibilities for data synthesis are explored. Our findings confirm that Sentinel-2 has excellent performance for meeting several essential coral reef scientific and monitoring objectives. Taking into account cloud and sun glint, the usable acquisition rate for a large proportion of reefs is likely to be around 20 clear images a year on average, giving a new potential for evaluation of short time-scale disturbances and impacts. The spatial resolution of 10 m is a key threshold for delineating benthic features of interest such as coral structures, and there is evidence from image and field data that bleaching is detectable. Radiometrically Sentinel-2 data can support good results in physics-based methods, such as bathymetric mapping, comparable to Landsat 8 and WorldView-2. In addition the large scale acquisition area, provided by the 290 km wide swath, offers advantages over high spatial resolution imagery for mapping at multi-reef scales. Sentinel-2 data can be immediately leveraged with existing methods, to provide a new level of reef monitoring information compared to that previously available by remote sensing. Combined with Landsat 8 and the historical Landsat archive, the data collected today will be invaluable for decades or even centuries to come. In this context, the main downside of the Sentinel-2 mission is that approximately 12{\%} of the World's reefs currently lie outside the acquisition plan and are not imaged. Surprisingly, for a European initiative, coral reefs in European governed territories are among the worst served globally. These omissions, approximately only 1/200th of the currently imaged area, limit the global scope which otherwise would be one of Sentinel-2's greatest strengths.},

abstract = {Remote sensing from satellites and airborne platforms provides valuable data for monitoring and gauging river discharge. One effective approach first estimates river stage from satellite-measured inundation area based on the inundation area-river stage relationship (IARSR), and then the estimated river stage is used to compute river discharge based on the stage-discharge rating (SDR) curve. However, this approach is difficult to implement because of a lack of data for constructing the SDR curves. This study proposes a new method to construct the SDR curves using remotely sensed river cross-sectional inundation areas and river bathymetry. The proposed method was tested over a river reach between two USGS gauging stations, i.e., Kingston Mines (KM) and Copperas Creek (CC) along the Illinois River. First a polygon over each of two cross sections was defined. A complete IARSR curve was constructed inside each polygon using digital elevation model (DEM) and river bathymetric data. The constructed IARSR curves were then used to estimate 47 river water surface elevations at each cross section based on 47 river inundation areas estimated from Landsat TM images collected during 1994–2002. The estimated water surface elevations were substituted into an objective function formed by the Bernoulli equation of gradually varied open channel flow. A nonlinear global optimization scheme was applied to solve the Manning's coefficient through minimizing the objective function value. Finally the SDR curve was constructed at the KM site using the solved Manning's coefficient, channel cross sectional geometry and the Manning's equation, and employed to estimate river discharges. The root mean square error (RMSE) in the estimated river discharges against the USGS measured river discharges is 112.4 m3/s. To consider the variation of the Manning's coefficient in the vertical direction, this study also suggested a power-law function to describe the vertical decline of the Manning's coefficient with the water level from the channel bed lowest elevation to the bank-full level. The constructed SDR curve with the vertical variation of the Manning's coefficient reduced the RMSE in the estimated river discharges to 83.9 m3/s. These results indicate that the method developed and tested in this study is effective and robust, and has the potential for improving our ability of remote sensing of river discharge and providing data for water resources management, global water cycle study, and flood forecasting and prevention.},

abstract = {Coral reefs are crucial for the maintenance of the marine ecological environment and for the sustainability of local societies and economies. The use of remote sensing methods with the support of field data has been proposed for mapping coral reef habitats and bathymetry. However, the geomorphology of coral reefs over substantial areas is poorly documented, because of the absence of field data, especially in disputed areas where in situ investigation is difficult. In this study, we developed a simple method for mapping the inundation frequency (within the penetration range of optical remote sensing) of coral reefs using time-series Landsat-8 OLI images. The method uses the reef-water reflectance contrast (which varies with bathymetry, bands, and water level) in time-series optical multi-band images in order to derive the inundation frequency and geomorphic zonation of coral reefs. The method was applied to the Spratly Islands—the largest coral reef system in the South China Sea (SCS) using more than 1,100 Landsat-8 OLI images. We established an inventory which comprises 137 reefs/sandbanks/islands, including their spatial extent, inundation frequency, and geomorphic zonation. We also interestingly found that the inundation frequency of reef flats around reclaimed areas has decreased since island construction, which probably reflects the influence of anthropogenic activity on the coral reef ecosystem. Our approach was validated by a study of the Great Barrier Reef in Australia, which demonstrated that the inundation frequency of coral reefs can serve as an indirect representation of their bathymetry.},

abstract = {Despite being one of the most important and well-studied coral reefs in the world, the full extent of coral habitat of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) is not well mapped and there is no current and comprehensive map of the GBR's geomorphic zonation or benthic composition. This paper demonstrates an approach that integrates ecological coral habitat mapping with empirical modelling to map the geomorphic zonation and benthic composition of the “shallow offshore reefs” of the GBR, using the Capricorn Bunker Group (CBG) as a case study. The approach combined environmental data sets and geo-ecological rule sets to identify geomorphic zones. The benthic composition of individual geomorphic zones was mapped for: shallow reef flat zones, using object-based image analysis with context driven rules based on coral reef ecology; and reef slope zones, using levels of wave exposure to predict the distribution of coral types. The environmental data sets used were field-based benthic composition data, Landsat 8 OLI satellite image-derived bottom reflectance, water depth and slope (15 m × 15 m pixel size) data, reef impact data, and modelled wave exposure. The study showed that the combination of geomorphic-ecological rules and models with remote sensing imagery provided robust mapping results over a large ({\~{}}2500 km2) reef system, of which 245 km2 was mapped as shallow coral reefs and 88 km2 of that was mapped as areas containing coral. Most importantly, the method produced defined the geomorphic zones and benthic composition of a study area that is significantly larger than the majority of coral reef remote sensing mapping projects previously published. With some modifications, the methods presented have the potential to be applied to the full extent of the shallow offshore reefs of the GBR, or any large reef globally. Monitoring and management of coral reefs for conservation and other purposes, at regional to global scales will benefit from the ability to produce and use this type of essential information on a regular basis.},

abstract = {We evaluate different techniques that rebuild reservoir bathymetry by combining multi-satellite imagery of surface water elevation and extent. Digital elevation models (DEMs) are processed in two distinct ways in order to determine 3-D reservoir bathymetry. They are defined as (a) linear extrapolation and (b) linear interpolation. The first one linearly extrapolates the land slope, defining the bottom as the intersection of all extrapolated lines. The second linearly interpolates the uppermost and lowermost pixels of the reservoir's main river, repeating the process for all other tributaries. A visible bathymetry, resulting from the combination of radar altimetry and water extent masks, can be coupled with the DEM, improving the accuracy of techniques (a) and (b). Envisat- and Altika-based altimetric time series is combined to a Landsat-based water extent database over the 2002–2016 period in order to generate the visible bathymetry, and topography is derived from the 3-arcsec HydroSHEDS DEM. Fourteen 3-D bathymetries derived from the combination of these techniques and datasets, plus the inclusion of upstream and downstream riverbed elevations, are evaluated over Lake Mead. Accuracy is measured using ground observations, and show that metrics improve as a function of added data requirement and processing. Best bathymetry estimates are obtained when the visible bathymetry, linear extrapolation technique and riverbed elevation are combined. Water storage variability is also evaluated and shows that best results are derived from the aforementioned combination. This study contributes to our understanding and representation of reservoir water impoundment impacts on the hydrological cycle.},

abstract = {Lake water storage changes in four lakes were analyzed based on in situ bathymetric survey data and Landsat images in the extremely dry and cold northwestern Tibetan Plateau region. The results indicated that Bangdag Co and Aksai Chin Lake, which are glacier-fed and closed lakes, showed decreasing trends from 1976 to 1996, then increasing trend from 1996 to 2015, during which period water storage increased by 1.24 km3 and 1.37 km3, respectively, and 65{\%} of the water storage increase in Aksai Chin Lake during this period occurring in 2006 and 2013. Longmu Co, which is a non-glacier-fed lake, exhibited little variation from 1976 to 1996 and a slight increase of 0.1 km3 from 1996 to 2015. The precipitation, temperature and potential evaporation (Ep) trends indicated that lake shrinkage from 1976 to 1996 was attributed to less precipitation and less meltwater at lower surface air temperatures. Decreased Ep (15.5 mm/y) contributed approximately 2{\%} and 4{\%} to the lake expansion of Aksai Chin Lake and Bangdag Co from 2000 to 2009. Based on the assumption of equal precipitation-evaporation for the study area, glacial meltwater contributed 76.6{\%} to the lake expansion of Bangdag Co from 2000 to 2015. Because change in lakes' water storage showed a large difference between glacier-fed lakes and non-glacier-fed lakes from 1996 to 2015 under relatively high precipitation conditions, it is suggested that glacial meltwater exerted more influence on increasing lake water storage associated with rising temperatures.},

abstract = {Lake water storage is an important factor in analyses of lake water balance. However, it is difficult to calculate the water storage of lakes on the Tibetan Plateau due to the lack of bathymetric data. Lake water storage and changes in Chibuzhang Co (CC) and Duoersuodong Co (DC), which are located in an endorheic system and have been connected since 2006, were estimated based on in situ bathymetric data, satellite altimetry data and Landsat images of the central Tibetan Plateau. In 2016, the maximum depth and water storage of DC were 68.7 m and 12.2 ± 1.72 km3, respectively, with an area of 490.2 km2, and those of CC were 116.3 m and 16.2 ± 2.27 km3, respectively, with an area of 575.4 km2. The total lake water storage in DC and CC increased by 24.5{\%} (2.4 km3) and 14.1{\%} (2 km3) from 2003 to 2014, respectively, based on satellite altimetry data and Landsat images using an empirical equation. The relationship between lake changes and meteorological factors indicated that both increased glacial meltwater and increased precipitation were important drivers of each lake's expansion and that a small increase in evaporation (2.5 mm/y) had little negative impact on lake expansion (0.41 m/y). Heterogeneous changes in the two lakes from 1993 to 2005 were mainly due to water from CC supplying DC through a channel, and the lake level of DC was always lower than that of CC until 2006, indicating that the geological conditions around both lakes were also an important factor in the lake changes. The assumption was that all glacial meltwater from the Puruogangri and Geladandong glaciers was supplied to the two lakes through runoff with minimal evaporation, and glacial meltwater made an approximately 19.3 ± 4.5{\%} contribution to the lake expansions (0.4 km3/y) of DC and CC from 2003 to 2014 based on the results of the glacier mass balance.},

abstract = {The study of the changes in swell properties in the nearshore domain due to interaction with the sea-bottom to infer the bathymetry has deserved some attention in the last few years. Satellite Remote Sensing images, in particular Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), have been used to produce a directional wave spectrum by Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), from which the wavelength and wave direction of the ocean surface waves can be retrieved. These wave properties can be directly used in the linear dispersion relation to estimate the water depth. The present work takes advantages from the very short revisit times of the Sentinel-1A with C-band (5.405 GHz) SAR images with 10 m of spatial resolution to study the repeatability of this methodology for deriving the nearshore sea-bottom morphology, using a case study in the Aveiro region, located in the Portuguese West Coast. This site is exposed to high energetic wave climate of the North Atlantic Ocean. Overall, a set of four images were selected for the analysis. The robustness of the FFT methodology to calculate the wavelength and wave direction from SAR images was analysed through calculating their standard deviations. The errors of estimating the local bathymetry from these quantities was accessed which allowed to quantify the water depth limits of application of this methodology. The set of images was used to establish a bathymetric estimation that merges the derived bathymetry of each image. The computed bathymetry was quantitatively compared with the measurements made in 2013 and available at RAIA Observatory. The relative error of the water depth ranges between 6{\%} and 10{\%}, but increases for the higher depths and depends on the accuracy of the computed wavelength at deep-waters. The merged derived bathymetry also provides a better approximation for the measured bathymetry than those derived from the individual images.},

Based on the analysis of hydrometeorological observations, lake water balance, lake evaporation and Budyko equations, driven by gridded climate and global atmospheric reanalysis datasets, we evaluate the impact of historical climatic conditions on the water balance of the BNNP lake catchments. The total surface water area of the BNNP lakes decreased by around 7{\%} for that period, mainly due to a reduction in the extent of three main lakes. In contrast, for some smaller lakes, the surface area increased. Overall, we attribute the decline of the BNNP lakes' areal extent and volume to the prolonged periods of water balance deficit when lake evaporation exceeded precipitation. However, during the most recent years (2013–2016) precipitation increased and the BNNP lake levels stabilized.},

abstract = {Suspended particulate matter (SPM) consists both of an organic (OSPM) and an inorganic fraction (ISPM) and the latter can be used as an indicator for coastal influence in the Baltic Sea. The concentration of SPM can be derived from particle scatter if the specific scattering properties of the respective water body are known. In this paper we show that likewise, ISPM can be derived reliably from remotely sensed particle scatter. An empirical algorithm between particle scatter (AC9 data) and ISPM concentration (measured gravimetrically) was derived from in-water measurements. This regional algorithm was then applied to the iop{\_}bpart level 2 product (i.e. the particle scatter measured at 443 nm) derived from OLCI data on Sentinel-A (S3A) using the C2RCC neural network and validated against an independent data set. The standard error of the derived OLCI match-up data was 10{\%}, and was thus within the goal of the mission requirements of Sentinel-3. The generated S3 composite images from spring and autumn 2018 show that in the Baltic Sea most of the ISPM falls out rather close to the shore, whereas only a very small proportion of ISPM is carried further off-shore. This is also supported by in situ ISPM transects measured in the coastal zone. The ISPM images clearly highlight the areas that are most strongly influenced by terrestrial matter. Differences between the NE Baltic and the SE Baltic proper can be explained by the difference in hydrology and coastal influence as well as bathymetry and wind-wave stirring. The method is of interest for coastal zone management and for assessing the effect of seasonal changes in terrestrial run-off and wind-driven resuspension of sediments. It can also be used to evaluate the effect of climate change which has led to an increase of extreme storm and flooding events that are usually accompanied by increased erosion and run-off from land. Last but not least, turbidity caused by particles influences the light conditions in inner coastal areas and bays, which has a profound effect on pelagic productivity, the maximum growth of macroalgae as well as fish behaviour.},

Moreover, the results indicated that the computed amount of sediment using the estimated depths from the RS data (the present approach) overestimated the results by 4.16{\%} compared to those computed using the cross-section method adopted by AHDA. On the other hand, the results indicate that the present approach overestimates sediment amount by about 3.93{\%} compared to the results derived from the generated 3D profiles of the Lake based on the field measurements.},

abstract = {The instability of lava deltas is a recurrent phenomenon affecting volcanic islands, which can potentially cause secondary events such as littoral explosions (due to interactions between hot lava and seawater) and tsunamis. It has been shown that Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) is a powerful technique to forecast the collapse of newly emplaced lava deltas. This work goes further, demonstrating that the monitoring of lava deltas is a successful strategy by which to observe the long-term deformation of subaerial–submarine landslide systems on unstable volcanic flanks. In this paper, displacement measurements derived from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery were used to detect lava delta instability at Stromboli volcano (Italy). Recent flank eruptions (2002–2003, 2007 and 2014) affected the Sciara del Fuoco (SdF) depression, created a “stacked” lava delta, which overlies a pre-existing scar produced by a submarine–subaerial tsunamigenic landslide that occurred on 30 December 2002. Space-borne X-band COSMO-SkyMED (CSK) and C-band SENTINEL-1A (SNT) SAR data collected between February 2010 and October 2016 were processed using the SqueeSAR algorithm. The obtained ground displacement maps revealed the differential ground motion of the lava delta in both CSK and SNT datasets, identifying a stable area (characterized by less than 2 mm/y in both datasets) within the northern sector of the SdF and an unstable area (characterized by velocity fields on the order of 30 mm/y and 160 mm/y in the CSK and SNT datasets, respectively) in the central sector of the SdF. The slope stability of the offshore part of the SdF, as reconstructed based on a recently performed multibeam bathymetric survey, was evaluated using a 3D Limit Equilibrium Method (LEM). In all the simulations, Factor of Safety (F) values between 0.9 and 1.1 always characterized the submarine slope between the coastline and −250 m a.s.l. The critical surfaces for all the search volumes corresponded to the 30 December 2002 landslide, which involved the lava delta and its surrounding areas. InSAR data provided the post-effusive deformation field after the 2007 and 2014 flank eruptions, whereas LEM results highlighted that the accumulation of lava flows on the prone-to-failure SdF submarine slope is the main cause of the detected lava delta deformation. Lava delta instability, measured also at Pico Island (Azores) and Kilauea volcano (Hawaii), is evidence of the broader spectrum of instability phenomena that take place in the coastal or submarine area of the flanks of the volcanoes. At Kilauea, past lava deltas have moved faster than the surrounding slope and the recorded movements relate only to the collapses of the deltas themselves, producing rapid mass wasting near the coasts. In contrast, at Stromboli and Pico, lava deltas move at the same velocity as the surrounding slope. In these cases, the displacement at lava deltas can be considered as a proxy for the deformation of submarine slides. There are very few studies dealing with lava delta deformation, thus, the analysis presented in this work will benefit the monitoring of submarine slopes in other prone-to-failure coastal or island volcanic systems which have the potential to generate tsunamis.},

abstract = {Determining the spatiotemporal dynamics of surface water in a heterogeneous floodplain is difficult, especially for its surrounding isolated lakes. Seasonal inundation patterns of these isolated lakes can be misestimated in a hydrodynamic model due to their short and erratic appearances. A surface water time series of Poyang Lake having an 8-day revisit frequency with a 30 m spatial resolution from 2000 to 2016 was conducted for the first time. This study was produced with a modified hierarchical spatiotemporal adaptive fusion model (HSTAFM) by integrating both Landsat and MODIS data. Discrepancies between model-based surface water and remotely-sensed surface water were evaluated, and possible causes were discussed. Results show that the modified HSTAFM can better detect the water features of a floodplain, thereby providing more detailed information in an seasonal isolated lake system than the MODIS MOD13Q1 product. With the fusion product, we found that Poyang Lake evidently shrank after experiencing a longer low-water period after the impoundment of the Three Gorges Dam. A large proportion of these discrepancies (averaging 36{\%}) between model-based and remotely-sensed surface water distributed in seasonal isolated lakes, mainly occurred during high-water level periods. Uncertainties in the hydrodynamic model might attribute to smaller defined lake boundaries, bathymetric variations, human disturbance, and unconsidered groundwater recharge/discharge. These results provide a new insight into the temporally continuous and spatially dynamic assessment of simulated surface water, which is essential for the future improvement in the hydrodynamic model.},

abstract = {Mediterranean seagrasses have been hailed for their numerous ecosystem services, yet they are undergoing a decline in their coverage. The major complication with resolving this tendency is the sparsity of data on their overall distribution. This study addresses the suitability of the recently launched Sentinel-2 satellite for mapping the distribution of Mediterranean seagrass meadows. A comprehensive methodology is presented which applies atmospheric and analytical water column corrections and compares the performance of three different supervised classifiers. Remote sensing of the Thermaikos Gulf, northwestern Aegean Sea (Greece, eastern Mediterranean Sea) reveals that the utilization of Support Vector Machines on water column corrected reflectances yields best accuracies. Two Mediterranean seagrasses, Posidonia oceanica and Cymodocea nodosa, cover a total submerged area of 1.48 km2 between depths of 1.4–16.5 m. With its 10-m spatial resolution and 5-day revisit frequency, Sentinel-2 imagery can mitigate the Mediterranean seagrass distribution data gap and allow better management and conservation in the future in a retrospective, time- and cost-effective fashion.},

abstract = {Central-southern Chile is characterized by a series of large lakes that originate in the Andes Mountains. This region is facing increasing anthropogenic impact, which threatens the oligotrophic status of these lakes. While monitoring programs are often based on a limited spatial and temporal coverage, remote sensing offers promising tools for large-scale observations improving our capacity to study comprehensively indicators of lake properties. Seasonal trends (long-term means) and intra-lake variation of surface water temperature (SWT), turbidity and chlorophyll a in Lake Panguipulli were studied through satellite imagery from Landsat 5 TM, 7 ETM+ and 8 OLI (1998–2018; SWT, turbidity), and Sentinel-2A/B MSI (2016–2017; chlorophyll). Remotely sensed data were validated against in situ data from monitoring database. Satellite-derived SWT (representing the surface skin layer of water, so-called skin temperature) showed good similarity with in situ (bulk) temperature (RRMSD 0.17, R2 = 0.86), although was somewhat lower (RMSD of 2.77 °C; MBD of −2.10 °C). Seasonal long-term means of turbidity from satellite imagery corresponded to those from in situ data, while satellite-derived predictions (based on OC2v2 algorithm) overestimated chlorophyll a levels slightly in summer-spring. SWT ranged from 8.0 °C in winter to 17.5 °C in summer. Mean turbidity (1.6 FNU) and chlorophyll a (1.1 $\mu$g L−1) levels were at their lowest in summer. Spatial and seasonal patterns reflected the bathymetry and previously described mixing patterns of this monomictic lake: warming of shallow bays in spring extended to wider area along with summer stratification period, while mixing of the water column was reflected in spatially more homogenous SWT in fall-winter. Spatial heterogeneity in summer was confirmed by a clear separation of different lake areas based on SWT, turbidity and chlorophyll a using 3-D plot. Mapping of spatial and seasonal variation using satellite imagery allowed identifying lake areas with different characteristics, improving strategies for water resource management.},

abstract = {Coastal habitats provide a plethora of ecosystem services, yet they undergo continuous pressure and degradation due to the human-induced climate change. Conservation and management imply continuous monitoring and mapping of their spatial distribution at first. The present study explores the capabilities of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission and the contribution of its coastal aerosol band 1 (443 nm) for the mapping of the dominant Mediterranean coastal marine habitats and the bathymetry in three survey sites in the East Mediterranean. The selected sites have shallow to deep habitats and a high variability of oceanographic and seabed morphological conditions. The major findings of our study demonstrate the advantages of the downscaled Sentinel-2 coastal aerosol band 1 for both optically shallow habitat and satellite-derived bathymetry mapping due to its great water penetration. The use of Sentinel-2 band 1 allows detection of Posidonia oceanica seagrass beds down to 32.2 m of depth. Sentinel-2 constellation with its 10-m spatial resolution at most of the spectral bands, 5-day revisit frequency and open data policy can be an important tool to provide crucial missing information on the spatial distribution of coastal habitats and on their bathymetry distribution, especially in data-poor and/or remote areas with large gaps in a retrospective, rapid and non-intrusive manner. As such, it becomes a crucial ally for the conservation and management of coastal habitats globally.},

This paper aims to assess the performance of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) in estimating the bathymetry of the Eastern harbor of Alexandria Egypt as a case study. This area of the case study represents a low turbid, mud bottom and shallow water area. The estimation of shallow water depth is based on ANN fitting algorithms using the logarithms of multispectral bands reflectance value. The estimation of water depths using optical bands of Landsat-8 multispectral images is extracted directly without regard to other environmental factors (bottom type and sea sediments). The images are first corrected for the effects caused by atmospheric conditions and sun specular. The bands are then calibrated using reference measurements obtained using GPS and single beam echo sounder in the study area. The estimated depths using ANN based on bands 1 {\&}3, 3 only and 2 {\&}3 show higher correlations and lower root mean square error compared the estimation made by previously developed statistically equations which were updated using the same data sets used in developing the ANNs.

@article{Pacheco2015,
abstract = {Nearshore bathymetry is likely to be the coastal variable that most limits the investigation of coastal processes and the accuracy of numerical models in coastal areas, as acquiring medium spatial resolution data in the nearshore is highly demanding and costly. As such, the ability to derive bathymetry using remote sensing techniques is a topic of increasing interest in coastal monitoring and research. This contribution focuses on the application of the linear transform algorithm to obtain satellite-derived bathymetry (SDB) maps of the nearshore, at medium resolution (30. m), from freely available and easily accessible Landsat 8 imagery. The algorithm was tuned with available bathymetric Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data for a 60-km-long nearshore stretch of a highly complex coastal system that includes barrier islands, exposed sandy beaches, and tidal inlets (Ria Formosa, Portugal). A comparison of the retrieved depths is presented, enabling the configuration of nearshore profiles and extracted isobaths to be explored and compared with traditional topographic/bathymetric techniques (e.g., high- and medium-resolution LiDAR data and survey-grade echo-sounding combined with high-precision positioning systems). The results demonstrate that the linear algorithm is efficient for retrieving bathymetry from multi-spectral satellite data for shallow water depths (0 to 12. m), showing a mean bias of -. 0.2. m, a median difference of -. 0.1. m, and a root mean square error of 0.89. m. Accuracy is shown to be depth dependent, an inherent limitation of passive optical detection systems. Accuracy further decreases in areas where turbidity is likely to be higher, such as locations adjacent to tidal inlets. The SDB maps provide reliable estimations of the shoreline position and of nearshore isobaths for different cases along the complex coastline analysed. The use of freely available satellite imagery proved to be a quick and reliable method for acquiring updated medium-resolution, high-frequency (days and weeks), low-cost bathymetric information for large areas and depths of up to 12. m in clear waters without wave breaking, allowing almost constant monitoring of the submerged beach and the shoreface.},

abstract = {This study examines the relatively high-resolution MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) onboard Sentinel-2A and 2B for generating bathymetric maps through a ratio transform model in South Florida (United States). Atmospheric correction of imagery is implemented though ACOLITE software, providing accurate performance and consistency over different Sentinel-2A/B scenes and three different study sites. Vertical calibration uses 5–10 points collected from digital charts, independent of lidar surveys, which are used for validation and error analysis. Satellite-Derived Bathymetry (SDB) has Median Absolute Error (MedAE) of 0.5 m in West Palm Beach (at depths ranging between 0 and 18 m, limit of lidar survey for validation), 0.4 m in Key West (0–5 m), and 0.22 m in Dry Tortugas (0–6 m), in conditions with low turbidity. Accurate bathymetry mapping can be accomplished with both sensors over environments with varying water transparency conditions, with the advantage of a fast, flexible, and economical solution. The 10-m MSI can capture small-scale features, such as tidal channels, straits relevant to navigation or steep slopes. While the least error is achieved by calibrating each image separately, a generic calibration produces only a moderately greater error with MedAE still ∼1m, indicating the robustness of the approach. The research highlights the great potential of the 5-day revisit, suggesting that the twin Sentinel-2 mission of the Copernicus programme may enhance SDB to leverage its use for several operational purposes, particularly in remote and inaccessible regions of the world.},

abstract = {Surface runoff constitutes a large percentage of Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) mass loss at present but is difficult to measure directly. This study provides a novel method to estimate surface runoff through remote sensing of supraglacial lake volumes. Because terminal, non-draining (consistently expanding during the melt season) lakes impound runoff from their surrounding contributing catchments, such changes reflect runoff produced within the catchment. To estimate supraglacial lake volumes, multi-temporal lake maps derived from Landsat-8 images are intersected with dry lake-bed topographic depressions (showing lake bathymetry) identified for two supraglacial catchments ({\~{}}10 km2) in southwestern GrIS, using high-resolution (2 m) ArcticDEMs. Intersecting remotely sensed lake shorelines with their underlying ice surface topography yields multi-temporal lake volume changes, which are then compared with cumulative runoff as simulated by four Surface Mass Balance (SMB) models (HIRHAM5, MAR3.6, RACMO2.3, and MERRA-2). Comparison of cumulative lake infilling with SMB simulations for these two lakes over the period 8–31 July 2015 indicates that SMB models overestimated surface runoff by 106 – 123{\%}. These large offsets improved after early July, overestimating runoff by 40 – 55{\%}. The runoff delay function incorporated into the MAR3.6 model improves simulation of early melt season runoff, signifying the importance of integrating meltwater routing schemes into SMB models for improved understanding of Greenland supraglacial hydrology and surface mass balance.},

abstract = {In August 2019 a large raft of pumice appeared in the territorial waters of Tonga. As in many other cases, this pumice raft was the only surface expression of a major submarine volcanic eruption. Discolored water and reconstruction of the drift path of the pumice raft using satellite imagery points towards ‘Volcano F' in the Tofua Arc NW of the island of Vava'u as the most likely volcanic source. Here we present imagery from ESA's Sentinel-2 satellite that captured the start of the submarine eruption on 6 August 2019 and the waning of the eruption on 8 August, followed by observations of the drifting pumice raft until 14 August. This start time is consistent with T-phase records at the seismic stations on Niue Island and Rarotonga and the signal delay time of 733 s between the two stations is consistent with an origin at or at least near Volcano F. On 8 August, a {\textgreater}136.7 km2 large raft of pumice appears at the sea surface. The modelled minimum raft volume is 8.2–41.0*106 m3, which is equivalent to 2.5–12.3*106 m3 dense rock. The eruption thus corresponds to a volcanic explosivity index (VEI) 2–3 eruption in the submarine environment. Prior to the volcanic eruption, a series of earthquakes close to Volcano F was recorded. The series started on 5 August with a Mb 4.7 event, followed by at least six shallow earthquakes (Mb {\textgreater}3.9) on 6 August. In December 2018 and January 2019, we surveyed the seafloor around Volcano F with multibeam sonar. Combining our data with pre-existing information, we present the first comprehensive bathymetric map of the volcanic edifice and its geologic setting. We show that Volcano F represents a major arc volcanic complex that is situated in an extensional setting. The basal diameter of the volcanic apron is {\textgreater}50 km with a large central, 8.7 x 6 km caldera with a floor at ∼700 m water depth. The top of the post-caldera constructional cone complex had a summit depth of 35 m below sea level in 2004. The volcano shows geochemical differences to the adjacent arc volcanoes on Fonualei and Late islands. The volcano's pristine volcanic morphology and two documented eruptions (2001 and 2019) indicate a highly active volcanic system that warrants further scientific attention.},

To study this phenomenon in more detail, the existing semi-infinite 2SeaColour Radiative Transfer (RT) model was modified into a finite water layer model, bounded by a diffusely reflecting surface at the sea-bottom. From simulations with the new model, called Water - Sea Bottom (WSB) model, it was observed that a ratio of spectral bands in the Near-Infrared, bands 750 nm and 900 nm, is nearly insensitive to the WCCs and increases with the shallowness of the water, and therefore can be used as a robust index to detect OSWs. The newly established Near-Infrared Bottom Effect Index (NIBEI) was applied to a series of satellite observations over the Wadden Sea during high and low tidal phases. Images from the MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) and the Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) were processed to retrieve WCCs of the study area. The results indicate that the sea-bottom effect in OSWs affects the accuracy of atmospheric correction and retrievals. On the other hand, applying the NIBEI to flag OSWs improves the reliability and consistency of WCCs maps. The application of proposed NIBEI on satellite images requires only Top Of Atmosphere (TOA) radiances at 750 nm and 900 nm and does not depend on atmospheric correction and ancillary local input data (e.g., bathymetry map, bottom type, empirical coefficients, in-situ measurements). As a result, the proposed NIBEI can readily be applied to detect OSWs on various ocean colour remote sensors in various shallow coastal regions.},

abstract = {Lake morphometry is essential for managing water resources and limnetic ecosystems. For reservoirs that receive high sediment loads, frequent morphometric mapping is necessary to define both the effective life of the reservoir and its water storage capacity for irrigation, power generation, flood control and domestic water supply. The current study presents a methodology for updating the digital depth model (DDM) of lakes and reservoirs with wide intra and interannual fluctuations of water levels using satellite remote sensing. A time series of Terra MODIS satellite images was used to map shorelines formed during the annual water level change cycle, and were validated with concurrent Landsat ETM+ satellite images. The shorelines were connected with in-situ observation of water levels and were treated as elevation contours to produce the DDM using spatial interpolation. The accuracy of the digitized shorelines is within the mapping accuracy of the satellite images, while the resulting DDM is validated using in-situ elevation measurements. Two versions of the DDM were produced to assess the influence of seasonal water fluctuation. Finally, the methodology was applied to Lake Kerkini (Greece) to produce an updated DDM, which was compared with the last available bathymetric survey (1991) and revealed changes in sediment distribution within the lake.},

abstract = {A novel method for removing thin clouds from single satellite image is presented based on a cloud physical model. Given the unevenness of clouds, the cloud background is first estimated in the frequency domain and an adjustment function is used to suppress the areas with greater gray values and enhance the dark objects. An image, mainly influenced by transmission, is obtained by subtracting the cloud background from the original cloudy image. The final image with proper color and contrast is obtained by decreasing the effect of transmission using the proposed max– min radiation correction approach and an adaptive brightness factor. The results indicate that the proposed method can more effectively remove thin clouds, improve contrast, restore color information, and retain detailed information compared with the commonly used image enhancement and haze removal methods.

abstract = {The uneven illumination phenomenon caused by thin clouds will reduce the quality of remote sensing images, and bring adverse effects to the image interpretation. To remove the effect of thin clouds on images, an uneven illumination correction can be applied. In this paper, an effective uneven illumination correction algorithm is proposed to remove the effect of thin clouds and to restore the ground information of the optical remote sensing image. The imaging model of remote sensing images covered by thin clouds is analyzed. Due to the transmission attenuation, reflection, and scattering, the thin cloud cover usually increases region brightness and reduces saturation and contrast of the image. As a result, a wavelet domain enhancement is performed for the image in Hue-Saturation-Value (HSV) color space. We use images with thin clouds in Wuhan area captured by QuickBird and ZiYuan-3 (ZY-3) satellites for experiments. Three traditional uneven illumination correction algorithms, i.e., multi-scale Retinex (MSR) algorithm, homomorphic filtering (HF)-based algorithm, and wavelet transform-based MASK (WT-MASK) algorithm are performed for comparison. Five indicators, i.e., mean value, standard deviation, information entropy, average gradient, and hue deviation index (HDI) are used to analyze the effect of the algorithms. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively eliminate the influences of thin clouds and restore the real color of ground objects under thin clouds.},

abstract = {Clouds are obstructions for land-surface observation, which result in the regional information being blurred or even lost. Thin clouds are transparent, and images of regions covered by thin clouds contain information about both the atmosphere and the ground. Therefore, thin cloud removal is a challenging task as the ground information is easily affected when the thin cloud removal is performed. An efficient and effective thin cloud removal method is proposed for visible remote sensing images in this paper, with the aim being to remove the thin clouds and also restore the ground information. Since thin cloud is considered as low-frequency information, the proposed method is based on the classic homomorphic filter and is executed in the frequency domain. The optimal cut-off frequency for each channel is determined semi-automatically. In order to preserve the clear pixels and ensure the high fidelity of the result, cloudy pixels are detected and handled separately. As a particular kind of low-frequency information, cloud-free water surfaces are specially treated and corrected. Since only cloudy pixels are involved in the calculation, the method is highly efficient and is suited for large remote sensing scenes. Scenes including different land-cover types were selected to validate the proposed method, and a comparison analysis with other methods was also performed. The experimental results confirm that the proposed method is effective in correcting thin cloud contaminated images while preserving the true spectral information. {\textcopyright} 2014 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

abstract = {Most previous haze/cloud detection methods for Landsat imagery, e.g., haze optimized transformation (HOT), cannot adequately suppress land surface information and, in particular, often overestimate haze thickness over bright surfaces. This paper proposes an iterative HOT (IHOT) for improving haze detection with the help of a corresponding clear image. With an iterative procedure of regressions among HOT, the reflectance difference at the top of atmosphere (TOA) between hazy and clear images, and TOA reflectances of hazy and clear images, the land surface information can be removed, and the iterative HOT (IHOT) result is derived to spatially characterize the haze contamination in the Landsat images. A group of Landsat images that were acquired in different landscapes and seasons were used to test IHOT. Visual comparisons indicate that IHOT performed better than previous haze detection methods for images that were acquired in diverse landscapes and also performed robustly for hazy images that were acquired at different seasons when using the same reference clear image. Additionally, two indirect quantitative validations were used to illustrate that IHOT can provide the best transformation for accurately determining haze information. Therefore, it is expected that the proposed IHOT method will be used for automatic cloud/haze detection for large numbers of Landsat images if data sets of clear Landsat imagery are available.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2005 – ongoing JATIT  {\&}  LLS. Remote sensing data recorded from passive satellite system tend to be degraded by attenuation of solar radiation due to haze. Haze is capable of modifying the spectral and statistical properties of remote sensing data and consequently causes problem in data analysis and interpretation. Haze needs to be removed or reduced in order to restore the quality of the data. This study aims to restore the hazy data using proposed haze removal technique and evaluate its performance by means of spectral and statistical methods. In this study, initially, haze radiances due to radiation attenuation are removed by making use of pseudo invariant features (PIFs) selected among reflective objects within the study area. Spatial filters are subsequently used to remove the remaining noise causes by haze variability. The performance of hazy data restoration was evaluated using Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification. It is revealed that the technique is able to improve the classification accuracy to the acceptable levels for data with moderate visibilities and restored the spectral and statistical properties of the data and shows an increase in overall classification accuracy from 51.63{\%} to 82.62{\%}.},

The development of cloud effect removal techniques can maximize the usefulness of multispectral or hyperspectral images collected in the spectral range from visible to mid infrared. This paper presents a new data reconstruction technique, via dictionary learning and sparse representation, to remove the cloud effects. Dictionaries of the cloudy data (target data) and the cloud free data (reference data) are learned separately in the spectral domain, where each atom represents a fine ground cover component under the two imaging conditions. In this study, it is found that the sparse coefficients of the reference data are the true weightings of each atom, which can be used to replace the cloud affected coefficients to achieve data correction. Experiments were conducted using Landsat 8 OLI data sets downloaded from the USGS website. The testing results show that clouds of various thickness and cloud shadows can be removed effectively using the proposed method.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT$\backslash$nAfter atmospheric correction, an algorithm for the removal of thin cirrus cloud as well as alto-thin clouds or thin clouds collectively within visible and near infrared bands (Bands 1 through 5) of Landsat-8 was developed. The algorithm removed cirrus clouds using Band 9 first, and the remaining thin clouds using quality assurance (QA) band. Using a Landsat-8 sub-image of 129/39 (path/row) acquired on 16 December 2013, we evaluated the algorithm. Thin clouds disappeared visually. Reflectance values of Bands 1 through 4 decreased in both steps. Reflectance values of Band 5 decreased in step one, and then stayed the same. With a nearly cloud-free image acquired on 30 November 2013 as the "truth," the spatial correlation coefficients of cloud-covered pixels within the December image were 0.84 or higher. Changes in reflectance values of Bands 1 to 5, and the high correlation coefficient values indicated the validity of the algorithm.},

abstract = {Thin cirrus clouds frequently contaminate images acquired with either Landsat 7 ETM+ or the earlier generation of Landsat series satellite instruments. The situation has changed since the launch of the Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) into space in 2013. OLI implemented a cirrus detecting channel (Band 9) centered within a strong atmospheric water vapor absorption band near 1.375 $\mu$m with a width of 30 nm. The specifications for this channel were the same as those specified for the NASA Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) in the early 1990s. The OLI Band 9 has been proven to be very effective in detecting and masking thin cirrus-contaminated pixels at the high spatial resolution of 30 m. However, this channel has not yet been routinely used for the correction of thin cirrus effects in other OLI band images. In this article, we describe an empirical technique for the removal of thin cirrus scattering effects in OLI visible near infrared (IR) and shortwave IR (SWIR) spectral regions. We present results from applications of the technique to three OLI data sets. We also discuss issues associated with parallax anomalies in OLI data.},

abstract = {The detection of cirrus cloud has historically been difficult due to the lack of a 1.375�m wavelength band in earlier Landsat ETM+ imagery. Landsat 8 OLI has addressed this problem by adding a new cirrus band at this wavelength. This paper presents a study of the effectiveness of utilizing the newly available data for this purpose. An image-based method is developed for cirrus cloud contamination correction. The relationship between a visible or infrared band and the cirrus band is estimated via a linear regression using the data in a homogenous land cover area. The key issue of how to automatic identify homogenous background from the cirrus contaminated data is addressed. The images corrected by our method show satisfactory quality.},

abstract = {An algorithm for cloud removal in visible bands was developed. Thin clouds inside visible Bands 1-4 of Landsat-8 data acquired on 8 January 2014 disappeared after the algorithm. Values of mean and one standard deviation decreased, band-by-band. The reduction was supported by the leftward shift of the histogram curve in each band. To validate the algorithm, we used the cloud-free image acquired on 23 December 2013 of Landsat-8 as the reference image. Among the January image before the algorithm, the January image after the algorithm, and the reference image, values of mean and one standard deviation of the January image after the algorithm were much closer to those of the reference image. Histogram curves of the January image after the algorithm and the reference image were almost overlapped entirely. Spatial correlation coefficients of the January image before the algorithm and reference were 0.496, 0.547, 0.656, and 0.730 for Bands 1-4, respectively. Coefficients of the January image after the algorithm and reference image became 0.782, 0.822, 0.840, and 0.885 for Bands 1-4. In cloud-free areas, the algorithm did not alter spectral characteristics of cloud-free pixels. Thus, the algorithm was not only able to remove thin clouds, but also to preserve spectral characteristics of cloud-free pixels. The algorithm was then applied to other land use and land cover (LULC) types, and images acquired in other locations and seasons by Landsat-8 and WorldView-2 sensors. Results in cloud removal were satisfactory. Finally, this algorithm outperformed three widely-used cloud removal algorithms in comparison.},

abstract = {Optical satellite imagery is often contaminated by the persistent presence of clouds and atmospheric haze. Without an effective method for removing this contamination, most optical remote sensing applications are less reliable. In this research, a methodology has been developed to fully automate and improve the Haze Optimized Transformation (HOT)-based haze removal. The method is referred to as AutoHOT and characterized with three notable features: a fully automated HOT process, a novel HOT image post-processing tool and a class-based HOT radiometric adjustment method. The performances of AutoHOT in haze detection and compensation were evaluated through three experiments with one Landsat-5 TM, one Landsat-7 ETM+ and eight Landsat-8 OLI scenes that encompass diverse landscapes and atmospheric haze conditions. The first experiment confirms that AutoHOT is robust and effective for haze detection. The average overall, user's and producer's accuracies of AutoHOT in haze detection can reach 96.4{\%}, 97.6{\%} and 97.5{\%}, respectively. The second and third experiments demonstrate that AutoHOT can not only accurately characterize the haze intensities but also improve dehazed results, especially for brighter targets, compared to traditional HOT radiometric adjustment.},
